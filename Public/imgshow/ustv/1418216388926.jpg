00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,740
漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾
Previously on "Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,690
追捕我们就是浪费资源  准将
Chasing us is a waste of resources, General.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,670
我们都是好人
We're the good guys.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,140
你怎么评价哈特利的人
What's your assessment of Hartley's people?

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,540
他们是雇佣兵  只为钱办事
They're mercenaries, here for the money.

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,640
敌人有他们的优势  我们需要自己的优势
The enemy has the advantage. We need one of our own.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,970
你这么冒险就为了一架昆式战斗机吗
You risked that for a quinjet?

8
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,060
是为了它能让我们做到的事  消失
For what we can do with one. Disappear.

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,990
菲兹说他能做出隐形装置  但是
Fitz said he could engineer cloaking, but...

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,570
他的大脑颞叶大面积受损
the damage to his temporal lobe was too extensive.

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,420
西蒙斯走后  他的情况更糟了
Since Simmons left, he's only getting worse,

12
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,160
总是自言自语
talking to himself more and more.

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,640
这不是随便哪个084  这是第一个
It's not just an 0-8-4. It's the first.

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,970
弗瑞只知道  跟这东西沾边  没少死人
And all Fury knew about was the trail of bodies that follows it.

爱达荷
Hey, Idaho.

爱达荷  你能听见吗
Idaho, can you hear me?

克里尔步行逃走  但他马上就会找到交通工具
Creel's on foot. But he won't be for long.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,900
哈特利和爱达荷呢
Hartley and Idaho?

36
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,920
死了
Dead.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
后期：瓜瓜     总监：米小勒

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,310
没用的  挤住了
That's no use. It's jammed.

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,950
得把你救出去
We have to get you out of here!

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,390
我的腿也夹住了  别管我  没时间了
My leg is pinned. Don't worry about me. There's no time.

41
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,550
士兵来了
Soldiers are coming.

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,280
克里尔拿走了灼伤哈特利的东西
Creel has the damn thing that burned Harley!

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,160
你得去追他  快
You need to get him! Go!

44
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,840
好运
Good luck.

45
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,020
把手放在头上
Hands on your head!

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,530
跪下
On your knees!

神盾局特工
第二季 第二集

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,730
亨特疯了吗
What the hell was Hunter thinking?

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,610
他想救哈特利
He was trying to save Hartley!

51
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,890
你百分百确定
And you're absolutely sure?

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,520
他们死了  情况很糟  科尔森
They're gone. It was bad, Coulson.

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,930
两位特工身亡  另一位被捕
Two agents down, another captured.

54
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,420
本不该发生这种事的
This shouldn't have happened.

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,650
有发现
We got a hit.

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,710
警局接到报警
911 just picked up

57
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,120
有人在你前方劫持了一辆车
a stolen-vehicle call up the road from you.

58
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,320
老式红白卡车
Older model red-and-white pickup.

59
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,160
肯定是克里尔
That's got to be Creel.

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
梅  你在没有后援情况下于平民区接近敌人
May, you're approaching a civilian area without backup.

61
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,620
不要行动  听到吗
Do not engage. You copy?

62
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,950
听到吗
Do you copy?

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,740
梅  听起来可不像是秘密行动
May, that doesn't sound covert.

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,960
看到他了  接近中
I've got him. Closing in.

65
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,070
不  退后  不要行动
No, drop back. Do not engage.

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,210
重复  不要行动
I repeat -- do not engage.

67
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,470
他没注意到  我有机会射中他
He's not looking. I have a shot.

68
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,020
-不行  -我们不能放他走  科尔森
- Negative! - We can't just let him go, Coulson.

69
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,120
克里尔有同伙
Creel isn't working alone,

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,050
我要知道他的上级是谁
and I want to know who he answers to.

71
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,070
立刻改为监视行动
Drop back into surveillance mode now.

72
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,300
这是命令  梅特工
That's an order, Agent May!

73
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,220
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

74
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,080
我还是联系不上亨特或是哈特利
I still can't raise Hunter or Hartley on the comms.

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,450
不是什么大事
Not surprised.

76
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,390
无线电寂静是常规程序
Radio silence on the op is protocol.

77
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,470
那倒是  可我们离开时哈特利伤得很重
Still, Hartley was in pretty bad shape when we left.

78
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,220
我以为现在会知道进展了
Or you'd think we'd have heard something by now.

79
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,370
没必要往最糟的情况想
No need to think the worst

80
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,610
除非它对你摆手问好
till it shakes your hand and says hello.

81
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,500
又是你祖母的"名言"吗
Is that another one of your grandma's sayings?

82
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,500
福饼里的话
Fortune cookie.

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,700
那天我吃宫保鸡丁了
I had some kung pao chicken the other night.

84
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,440
也许科尔森有他们的消息
Maybe Coulson's heard from them.

85
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,450
在凯尼格特工回来之前
I need to get a complete inventory

86
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,270
我需要一份完整的存货清单
by the time Agent Koenig returns --

87
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,590
食物  燃油  弹药  明白吗
Food, fuel, and ammo -- understood?

88
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,460
你们搞到昆式战斗机了  好样的
You got the quinjet. Well done.

89
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,520
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

90
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,840
有哈特利的消息吗
Any word about Hartley?

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,950
先不提这个
Not now.

92
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,830
让迈克知道飞机到手
Let Mack know the jet's here.

93
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,290
我希望他马上逆向工程出隐形硬件
I want him reverse-engineering that cloaking hardware right away.

94
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,820
他越快完工  我们就可以越快地让空客重新上天
Sooner he does, sooner we get the bus operational again.

95
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,960
收到
Roger that.

96
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,390
还有事吗
Something else?

97
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,350
弄伤哈特利手的那物件
The item that messed up Hartley's arm,

98
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,060
上面有那些奇怪的符号
it had those weird symbols on it,

99
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,690
你让我调查的那些
the ones you've had me researching.

100
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,960
一模一样的
The same symbols?

101
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,850
-你确定  -确定
- You sure? - Yes.

102
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,090
它们出现在那东西上
They came up out of the object.

103
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,210
让我想到了盲文
It reminded me of braille.

104
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,040
好像哈特利一碰到它就触发了什么
It was like Hartley triggered something by touching it.

105
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,080
那到底是什么东西
What the hell is that thing?

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,340
我不知道  不过干得好
I have no idea. But good work.

107
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,480
"干得好"
"Good work"?

108
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,460
怎么不是"我靠  斯凯  咱们得拿到手"
How about, "Holy crap, Skye. We got to get on that"?

109
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,390
咱们一整个月到处搜索这东西
After a month of combing the planet for these things,

110
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,360
现在终于有线索了
we finally got a clue...

111
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,290
现在  我们有更严重的问题
Right now, we have more important problems...

112
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,430
五级火灾预警  也叫兰斯・亨特
A five-alarm fire otherwise known as Lance Hunter.

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
-他...  -被抓了
- Is he...  -captured.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
如果他开口  我们的整个行动都有危险
But if he talks, our entire operation's compromised.

115
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,050
我们得毁了这基地  赶紧撤离
We'll have to burn the base and evacuate.

116
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,910
我知道
I know.

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,920
我们才刚装修了浴室呢
And we just re-tiled the bathrooms.

118
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,320
我刚要睡着
Oh, just as I was dropping off to sleep.

119
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,560
谢了
Thank you very much.

120
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,420
先生们  能不能给我一瓶...
Excuse me, gents. Can I get a glass of...

121
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,320
水
...water?

122
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,320
亨特先生  相信我们还没见过
Mr. Hunter, I don't believe we've had the pleasure!

123
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,990
我是空军准将格伦・塔伯特
Brigadier general Glenn Talbot.

124
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,170
看来你需要有人载一程了  士兵
Looks like you need a lift, soldier.

125
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,550
这就是隐形硬件了
So, this is cloaking hardware.

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,750
咱们打开看看吧
Let's take a peek under the hood.

127
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,620
菲兹看到肯定会崩溃的
Fitz would be crushed if he saw this.

128
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,360
自从西蒙斯走了  他就一直在钻研隐形技术
He's been working on cloaking since before Simmons took off.

129
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,180
还是不敢相信她就那样抛弃了他
Still can't believe she abandoned him like that.

130
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,680
她抛弃了我们所有人
She abandoned all of us.

131
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,310
可菲兹一直把工作当成救命稻草般投入着
But Fitz has been clinging to his work like a lifeline, and...

132
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,420
也许我们不该告诉他
Maybe we shouldn't tell him.

133
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,640
科尔森想用这技术来隐形空客
Coulson wants a retro version of this for the bus.

134
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,230
他说没人比菲兹更懂这些航空电子设备
He said that no one knows the avionics on this thing like Fitz.

135
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,710
你觉得他能行吗
Think he can handle it?

136
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,490
不知道  不如直接问问他吧
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

137
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,590
菲兹
Hey, fitz.

138
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,940
怎么样  伙计
Hey, what's up, man?

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,550
你还好吗
How are you?

140
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,810
这就是...
So that's the, um...

141
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,740
就是那个...
That's the...

142
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,450
隐形装置  就是它
Cloaking, in all its glory.

143
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,870
你也没差多少
You know, you weren't that far off.

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,450
看看发射线圈
Check out the transmitter coil.

145
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,950
对  要抵消那个...共振
Yeah, to negate the.. the resonant... the...

146
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,390
共...共振
The... the resonant...?

147
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,840
不是...是那个...
No, um...the, uh...

148
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,810
没事  慢慢来
It's okay. Just take your time.

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,730
他想说的是
Uh, what he's trying to say is

150
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,980
隐形装置有音频成分
There's an audio component to cloaking

151
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,930
可以制造声波
that inverts sound waves, too.

152
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,260
就像噪音消除耳机吗
Like noise-canceling headphones?

153
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,220
对  一个意思
Yeah, same concept.

154
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,450
你能帮我吗
You think you can give me a hand with this?

155
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,500
这种情况下
Um, u-under the circumstances, uh...

156
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,130
重点是你得...
Well, the trick is you would...n...

157
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,630
重点是人工超常材料
The trick... the trick would be in the meta-materials.

158
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,570
哦对  但你得改动那个...
Uh, oh! Yeah, but you'd have to alter the, um...

159
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,450
菲兹
Fitz, it...

160
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,300
大家能不能先别说话
Yeah, could everyone just stop talking for one second?

161
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,830
不行  抱歉  我得走了
No, sorry. Gonna have to go.

162
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,410
有时候觉得他还是以前的菲兹
It's like sometimes he's the same old fitz,

163
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,160
-其他时候....  -就不是了
- And other times... - Not.

164
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,790
我现在相信了
Now I'll take your word for it.

165
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,390
不过  我还是需要多个人手帮忙
Meantime, I'm still gonna need an extra pair of hands.

166
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,250
大家都出任务回来了吗
Is everyone back from the mission?

167
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,400
还有人没回来
Not everyone.

168
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,020
塞拉利昂  三年前  想起来了吗
Sierra Leone, three years ago. Ring a bell?

169
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,420
08年在巴士拉呢
How about basra, '08?

170
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,760
豹爪行动
Operation panther's claw?

171
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,230
得了吧  上尉  这些故事都是真的吧
Come on, Lieutenant. Tell me the stories are true.

172
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,980
我已经不是上尉了  长官
I'm not a lieutenant anymore, sir.

173
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,840
为什么  孩子  你的履历这么出色
Why is that, son? Your record?

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
五次获得杰出贡献奖
Five commendations for distinguished service...

175
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,980
擅长编篮子和做陶器
Merits for basket weaving, pottery.

176
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,060
可别忘了这些
Don't forget those.

177
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,300
我只想知道像你这样的人
I'm just trying to figure out how a guy like you,

178
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,090
特种空勤部队的精英
one of the SAS's finest,

179
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,260
最后怎么会跟雇佣兵混在一起了
winds up running with a bunch of mouth-breathing mercs.

180
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,450
男人做事还能有什么原因啊  将军
Why does any man do anything, general?

181
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,350
我遇见了一个女孩
I met a girl.

182
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,880
听着  亨特  我觉得我们挺志趣相投的
Look, Hunter, I think we're pretty like-minded guys,

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
所以我们就别浪费对方的时间了
So let's don't waste each other's time.

184
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,190
你知道我想要什么
You know what I'm after.

185
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,900
看来不是卡尔・克里尔
Guessing it's not Carl Creel.

186
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,820
克里尔只是小虾兵  想想大鱼
Creel's small-time. Think big fish.

187
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,930
科尔森
Coulson.

188
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,320
科尔森
Coulson.

189
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,850
他就是个维持治安的
He's a vigilante...

190
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,300
一个为达目的不惜代价的狂热分子
A zealot who'll risk anything to further his own agenda.

191
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,010
但你很幸运  我知道有个
But lucky for you, I've got a senator

192
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,060
很有钱的议员想要找他
with very deep pockets that wants him.

193
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,540
所以你请便  开个价
So you go ahead. Name your price.

194
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,970
你肯定是开玩笑吧
You must be joking.

195
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,650
我没什么幽默感
I don't have a sense of humor.

196
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,750
如果我不把科尔森交给你呢  怎么
And if I don't give you Coulson, what?

197
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,450
把我扔海里吗
I go for a swim?

198
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,470
你应该知道我以前也刀口余生过  长官
You should know I've been helped out of a chopper before, sir.

199
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,750
科尔森闯进了一个重兵把守的政府部门
Coulson broke into a secure government facility,

200
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,150
他放走了一个疯子
he...he let a psychopath on the loose,

201
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,590
牺牲了自己手下  也是你朋友的命
sacrificed the lives of his own men... your friends.

202
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,690
为了什么呢
For what?

203
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,720
亨特  我不是来扮演坏警察的
Hunter, I'm not here to play bad cop.

204
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,100
我也用不着
I shouldn't have to.

205
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,340
我要200万美金
I want $2 million.

206
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,210
成交
Done.

207
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,660
还有一个体面的葬礼
And a proper burial.

208
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,500
什么
Excuse me?

209
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,780
为哈特利  她是个神盾局特工
For Hartley. She's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

210
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,950
你在电视上的说辞会让她被当做恐怖分子的
She'll be branded a terrorist after what you said on tv,

211
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,270
也许还会被丢在贫民墓地
probably dumped in a pauper's grave,

212
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,030
她的家人会不明白她到底出了什么事
her family wondering what happened to her.

213
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,820
他们不该被这样对待
They deserve better.

214
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,400
她也应该有更好的归宿
She deserves better.

215
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,970
我会确保这一点的
I'll make sure she gets it.

216
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,910
留意此物
"Keep an eye out for this."

217
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
我只是来汇报一下迈克和崔普
I just wanted to report that Mack and Trip

218
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,030
正在研究隐形的事  所以
are working on cloaking, so...

219
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,860
如果你需要我出外勤的话我有空
I'm free if you want me back in the field.

220
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,810
不用了  梅还在外面呢
That won't be necessary. May's still out there.

221
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,350
那哈特利和爱达荷呢
What about Hartley and Idaho?

222
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,150
他们不在了  是吧
They're not out there, are they?

223
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,190
是因为那东西  对吗  那个物件
It was that thing, wasn't it? The object.

224
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,620
是因为克里尔
It was Creel.

225
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,430
长官  我得出去
Sir, I need to get back out there

226
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,480
-帮梅把他消灭  -不行
- and help may take him down. - No.

227
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,740
她是我的监管人员
She's my S.O.

228
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,210
我现在是外勤特工了  我可以保护自己
I'm a field agent now, and I can handle myself.

229
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,390
-这不是重点  -那是什么
- That's not what this is about. - Then what is it about?

230
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,940
那个不明物  那些符号
The object? The symbols?

231
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,890
如果我不知道怎么回事我就帮不上忙
Because I can't help if I don't know what's going on.

232
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,600
如果你想帮忙
If you'd like to help,

233
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,000
去下面帮哈特利收拾东西吧
go down to the bunks, pack up Hartley's things.

234
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,270
好吧
Okay.

235
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,220
我知道你是领导
I know you're the boss,

236
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,630
你必须把所有事都安排好  但这不健康
and you have to compartmentalize everything, but it's not healthy.

237
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,910
你需要放松
You need to loosen up.

238
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,620
你可以试试瑜伽  或其他什么的
Try... yoga or something.

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,700
我试过  但我
I tried it, but I'm...

240
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,410
柔韧性不太好
really not flexible.

241
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,820
但谢谢
But thanks.

242
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,640
我们马上就要成功了
We were so close.

243
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,960
如果他们能多给我们点时间
If they'd just given us a little bit more time

244
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,170
去计算物体的
to calculate the object's...

245
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,870
折射率  对的
Refractive index, yeah.

246
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,100
这就是当今社会的问题
That's the problem these days --

247
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,120
每个人都要立即知道答案
Everyone needs answers immediately.

248
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,170
所有人都很没耐心
No one has any patience anymore.

249
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,530
是啊
Yeah.

250
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,650
我打赌他们肯定希望
I bet they're relishing the fact

251
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,830
我们没办法破解隐形装置
that we couldn't crack the cloaking device.

252
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,660
别傻了  菲兹
Don't be silly, Fitz.

253
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,440
这里的每个人都知道你对于团队的价值
Everyone here knows how valuable you are to the team.

254
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,960
他们把我当做瘟疫一样躲着
Well, they avoid me like the plague.

255
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,030
他们没有
They do not.

256
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,680
他们只是现在有自己的问题要忙
They just have their own problems right now.

257
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,660
是啊  那个克里尔
Oh, yeah. The Creel business.

258
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,490
事实上  也许他们需要我们的帮助
In fact, perhaps they need our assistance.

259
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,040
如果他们需要找到控制克里尔能力的方法
If they're looking for a way to neutralize Creel's ability...

260
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,120
对这些有异能的人  没人比我们更有经验了
No one has our experience with gifteds.

261
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,780
当然  我们不能把研究从他们那里抢过来
Of course, we can't just hijack the project from them.

262
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,550
那会打击他们的自信心
That would shatter their confidence.

263
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,200
是啊  不能那么做  不行
Yeah, no. Do not want to do that. No.

264
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,990
要不
Or do we?

265
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,020
-菲兹  -对  不行  这主意太蠢了
- Fitz... - Yeah. Yeah, no, no. Stupid, silly idea.

266
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,770
我不知道怎么会那么说
I don't know why I sai...

267
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,540
快看
Hey. Look.

268
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,330
那有一份全部研究的文件
There's a whole packet of research

269
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,350
他们就那么把它放在那了
They just left laying about all willy-nilly

270
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,990
给所有人看
for anyone to see.

271
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,710
这是克里尔的DNA结果
It's Creel's DNA results.

272
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,620
有意思
Interesting.

273
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,770
要不要看看我们能做点什么
Shall we see what we can do with these?

274
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,730
要  当然要  西蒙斯
Yes, we shall, Simmons.

275
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,260
当然要
Yes, we shall.

276
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,860
你还好吗  还在等朋友吗
You all good, hon? Are you still waiting on a friend?

277
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,970
-还在等  -那好吧
- Yeah, I'm still waiting. - All right, then.

278
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,360
不急
No hurry.

279
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,670
来  让我清理一下  请让让
Here, let me clear that. Excuse me.

280
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,140
可能我触电了
Think I got a shock.

282
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,670
静电什么的
Static electricity or something.

283
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,160
旅途咖啡馆

284
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,230
克里尔那边怎么样了
What's the status on Creel?

285
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,290
他进去已经一个多小时了
He's been in there for over an hour.

286
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,550
要么他是在等接应
Either he's waiting for a drop

287
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,590
要么就是已经烂醉了
or he's getting drunk off his ass.

288
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,220
出什么事了  科尔森  我要进去了
Something's happening, Coulson! I'm going in!

289
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,580
所有人  退后
Everybody, get back!

290
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,680
我不知道怎么了  她就是碰了下那个人
I don't know what happened! All she did was touch the guy!

291
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,570
-然后他跑了  -求你了
- and then he took off. - Please...

292
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,010
救救我
Help me!

293
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,060
坚持住
Hang on.

294
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,570
那女人只是碰了下他的胳膊
All the woman did was touch his arm.

295
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,610
我们知道克里尔可以吸收
We know that Creel absorbs

296
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,550
任何他碰到的东西的属性
the properties of whatever he touches.

297
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,940
他一定是吸收了方尖碑
He must have absorbed the obelisk

298
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,150
以及它的致命力量
and its deadly powers.

299
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,200
可他为什么要伤害一个服务生
But why hurt a waitress?

300
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
我觉得那不是刻意所为
I don't think it was intentional.

301
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,060
你是说他失控了
You're saying he's losing control?

302
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,950
神盾局最初发现他时
He had some control issues

303
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,650
他的控制力就有问题
when S.H.I.E.L.D. first came across him.

304
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,530
如果真是那样  任何接近他的人都有危险
If that's what's happening, anyone near him is at risk.

305
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,260
我那时本该出手的
I should have engaged when I had the chance.

306
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,380
那你也会死  如果要追究责任的话...
Then you'd be dead, too. If this is on anyone...

307
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
虽然你是指挥官
Just because you're director,

308
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,030
并不代表所有事情都得由你抗  菲尔  
doesn't mean everything's on you, Phil.

309
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,420
不  就是得我抗
Yes, it does.

310
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,860
消失  一切平复后就回来
Go dark. Get back when you can.

311
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,740
又怎么了
Now what?

312
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,600
警报

313
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,010
座驾不错
Nice ride.

314
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,130
哪个土豪借给你的吗
Some rich guy loan it to you?

315
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,790
差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

316
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,290
-不过轮子有点问题  是吧  -有点
- Shame about the rims, though, eh? - Yeah.

317
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,790
大概得1000美刀一个吧
Probably cost a grand each.

318
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,320
至少
At least. Mm.

319
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,680
-你不是来关心我的吧  -不是
- This isn't a friendly stop, is it? - Nope.

320
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,870
手放车上
Hands on the car.

321
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,010
你们怎么能跟丢了他
How the hell did you lose him?!

322
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,730
现在怎么还不派所有特工出去找他
Why haven't you got every agent out there looking for Creel right now?!

323
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,310
你觉得你有资格提问吗
You think you're entitled to answers?

324
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,810
他杀了我两个朋友  我觉得这就足够了
He killed two of my friends. I think that's entitlement enough.

325
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,690
并没有
Well, it's not.

326
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,140
你应该终止任务的
You should have aborted the mission.

327
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,070
哈特利应该听我的命令
Hartley should have followed my orders.

328
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,520
好吧  她尽力了
Yeah, well, she tried to.

329
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,230
伊兹错在听了我的话
Izzy's only mistake was listening to me.

330
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,730
这是你回来的原因吗
Is that why you came back?

331
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,990
悔恨  想要复仇
Guilt? A desire for revenge?

332
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,150
还是因为塔伯特给你承诺什么了
Or was it because of what Talbot promised you?

333
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,600
以上原因都有
All of the above.

334
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,740
这么说你跟他达成交易了
So you took the deal.

335
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,630
我有48小时把你交出来
I have 48 hours to deliver you.

336
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,980
否则你就死定了
Or else you're a dead man.

337
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,080
差不多吧
Words to that effect, yeah.

338
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
塔伯特
Talbot.

339
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,250
你没有把我们的位置给他
And you didn't give him our location?

340
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,050
别多想  我想那么做来着
Don't get me wrong. I thought about it.

341
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,350
他派了个四人小分队跟着我
He put a four-man detail on me.

342
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,640
用了三个小时才甩掉他们
Took three hours to shake them.

343
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,630
本来我可以直接带他们来的
I could have led them right to your door.

344
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,320
真感谢你改变主意
So kind of you to reconsider.

345
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,690
那么交出我你能得到什么呢
And in exchange for me, you get what, exactly?

346
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,150
为伊莎贝尔・哈特利举行一场像样的葬礼
A proper burial for Isabelle Hartley.

347
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,640
我希望她不会沾染什么罪名
I wanted to make sure her record was cleared,

348
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,780
家人也能得到很好的照料
that her family were properly notified.

349
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,690
是吗  就这点要求吗
Really? That's all?

350
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,710
听着  你和塔伯特
Look, between you and Talbot,

351
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,140
我知道你肯定能先抓到克里尔
I know you'll get to Creel first.

352
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,840
我只想要他
He's the only thing I want.

353
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,770
好吧  还有你欠我的钱
Well, that and the money you owe me.

354
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,540
你在开玩笑吧  有时候我分辨不出来
You're kidding, right? 'cause sometimes I can't tell.

355
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
我没开玩笑
No, I'm not.

356
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,820
我要我的工资  不光我的
I want my pay, and not just mine, either.

357
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,270
还要哈特利和爱达荷的
I want Hartley's and Idaho's, too.

358
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,560
好吧  这次你是在开玩笑了
Okay. Now you're kidding.

359
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,470
是为了给他们的家人
It's for their families.

360
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,840
我觉得他们应该得到补偿  你不觉得吗
I think they deserve something for their loss. Don't you think?

361
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,080
我会妥善安排的
I'll take care of it.

362
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,300
好
Good.

363
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,010
等我们抓了克里尔
Once we have Creel...

364
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,350
我会消失的
I'll be in the wind.

365
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,470
除非我死了
Or three sheets to it.

366
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,670
基因分析

367
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,390
他们为什么要从生物角度考虑
Why are they going the biochemical route?

368
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,870
从腺病毒的角度去对付克里尔的能力
Using an adenovirus factor to counter Creel's ability.

369
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,130
完全没意义  真的
Yeah, well, it's pointless, really,

370
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,950
因为注射的
since the injected, um...

371
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,870
注射的载体不会与细胞膜结合的
Injected vector will never bind to his cellular membranes.

372
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,820
对  所以  得想办法破坏
Yeah, so... well, then they'd have to find a way to destabilize...

373
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,090
克里尔上皮细胞的分子结构的稳定性
The molecular structure of Creel's epidermal cells, yeah.

374
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,360
破坏稳定性
Destabilize.

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,930
我今天没解决这个问题
I...I didn't solve this today.

376
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,770
你跟谁说话呢
Who you talking to?

377
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,470
-我呀  -什么  没谁
- Me. - What? No one.

378
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,480
你喜欢自言自语  没什么的
You like talking to yourself. That's cool.

379
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,740
很多人都喜欢这样
A lot of people do.

380
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,610
我喜欢洗澡的时候唱歌
You know, I like singing in the shower.

381
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,180
我知道这是两码事
Yeah, I know it's not really the same thing,

382
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,920
但是我也不希望别人听到
But I wouldn't want anyone to hear it.

383
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,530
你想干什么
What do you want?

384
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,170
关于隐形装置  你当时是想
All right, for cloaking, were you thinking about

385
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,670
用航天电子学还是
putting it under avionics or...?

386
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,510
别再提隐形装置了
Enough about cloaking.

387
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,980
我忙着  干别的事呢
I'm busy... with... something.

388
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,630
听起来你好像不想理我
Well, it sounds like you're just blowing me off.

389
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,260
你想一个人待着  没关系
You want to be alone? That's cool.

390
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,980
知道吗  我挺喜欢他的
You know, I think I like him.

391
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,060
他很诚实
He's honest.

392
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,830
我觉得是不会看脸色
Blunt, I'd say.

393
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,990
我是有话就直说的
I call them like I see them.

394
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,480
他并不像其他人那样和你说话
No, he doesn't talk to you like the others.

395
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,320
说实话  这感觉让人很舒服
It's quite refreshing, actually.

396
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,070
嘿  菲兹
Yo. Fitz.

397
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,200
-你又走神啦  -什么
- Your mind go wandering again? - What?

398
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,760
-看到了吧  -没有
- See? - No.

399
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,940
你手里拿的什么
What do you got there?

400
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,630
没  这只是
No... this... this is just, uh...

401
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,880
给他看看吧  也没坏处呀
Go ahead and show him. What harm would it do?

402
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,110
是和阻止克里尔有关的吗
Does it have something to do with stopping Creel?

403
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,950
是
Yeah.

404
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,030
我想
I think...

405
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,410
我想我们
I think that we are...

406
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,320
我  有
I-I... have...

407
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,830
我
I...

408
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,180
我今天没解决这个问题
I didn't solve this today.

409
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,650
但你觉得你能解决
You think you can?

410
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,880
那是伊兹的妹妹  简
Izzy's sister, Jane.

411
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,310
她在这世界上最爱的人
Her favorite person in the world.

412
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,930
当然啦  除我之外
After me, of course.

413
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,660
她俩看起来很亲密啊
Looks like they liked each other.

414
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,850
那两位啊  遇到一起
Yeah, those two, when they got together,

415
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,510
总有用不完的开心
there was a lot of laughs,

416
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,250
喝不够的酒
and bottles of wine.

417
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,090
伊兹对家人特别好
Izzy was good when it came to family.

418
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,170
所以这个我要拿走
Which is why I'm taking this.

419
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,610
这是她妈妈的
It belonged to her mum.

420
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,330
大概五年前死于乳腺癌
Died of breast cancer about five years back.

421
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,750
简现在也得了这病
Jane has it now, too.

422
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,030
这太糟糕了
That's awful.

423
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,950
是啊  生活有时就是很没道理
Yeah. Life can be a mean drunk that way.

424
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,330
坏事总是没眼色的接二连三的发生
Never knows when to stop punching.

425
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,640
你们是怎么认识的
How did you guys meet?

426
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,130
通过我那精神错乱的前妻
Through my psychotic ex-wife.

427
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,900
以前她俩是好朋友
Those two were good friends back in the day.

428
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,570
真的很遗憾
I'm really sorry.

429
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,670
失去关爱的人令人难以接受
Tough to lose people you care about.

430
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,990
想知道些诀窍吗
Secret to that?

431
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,900
别太依恋他们
Don't get attached.

432
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,090
试过了  没用
Tried that. Didn't work.

433
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,220
对你也一样
For you, either.

434
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,420
你令我想起了伊兹
You know, you remind me a bit of Izzy.

435
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,850
直接但却很机智  也有能力
Raw but sharp. You got skills.

436
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,080
你们这种单干能赚大钱
Type that could earn you some real money in the private sector.

437
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,980
当一名雇佣兵吗  算了吧
As a mercenary? Yeah, I don't think so.

438
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,260
我们更好喜欢称之为私人军队雇佣商
We prefer the term "Private military contractors."

439
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,170
别这么挑剔
Don't knock it.

440
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,850
每个人最终都需要有一个退出策略
Everyone needs an exit strategy eventually.

441
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,220
我不需要  现在神盾局就是我的人生
Not me . S.H.I.E.L.D's my life now.

442
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,380
神盾局不是人生
S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't a life.

443
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,230
那只是份工作  达到目的的手段而已
It's just a job -- a means to an end.

444
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,720
记住这点
Remember that.

445
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,110
有克里尔进一步的消息  通知我
You hear anything more about Creel, let me know.

446
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,010
无法连接

447
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,300
谁
Who's this?

448
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,570
晚上好  克里尔先生
Good evening, Mr. Creel.

449
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,000
我们一直试着联络你
We've been trying to reach you.

450
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,030
你当时到底在哪
Where the hell were you?

451
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,770
我在接头点等了一个小时
I waited at the drop site for an hour.

452
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,590
冷静点  克里尔先生  不必惊慌
Calm down, Mr. Creel. There's no need to panic.

453
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,900
我们谨慎行事是因为神盾局的介入
We're being cautious now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is a factor.

454
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,640
先别管他们  我有麻烦了
Forget them. I got a real problem.

455
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,000
那东西真的害惨我了
That thing really messed me up.

456
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,920
我一碰到它  就变成了橡胶
I turned to rubber when I touched it.

457
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,450
我以为它会保护我
Thought that it would protect me,

458
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,570
但我也被传染了
but it infected me, too.

459
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,230
我们很清楚你的情况
We're well aware of your condition.

460
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,100
如果你无法完成
But believe me when I say

461
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,500
怀特霍尔先生是不会选你来执行这项任务的
that Mr. Whitehall wouldn't have selected you for this job

462
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,660
相信我的话吧
if you weren't capable of completing it.

463
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,500
你根本不知道它对我造成的影响
You don't know what it's doing to me.

464
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,140
我无法保持能力
I can't keep it off.

465
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,040
一旦我们拿到方尖碑  你就会得到
Once we have the obelisk, you will be taken care of

466
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,410
九头蛇一如既往的照料
the way Hydra has always taken care of you.

467
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,860
请继续去第二个接头点
Please proceed to the secondary drop site,

468
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,290
适当的时候我会来见你的
and I shall meet you at the appropriate time.

469
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,150
晚安
Good night.

470
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,980
喂
Hello?!

471
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,180
看什么  你们在看什么
What?! What are you looking at?!

472
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,040
放过他们吧  克里尔先生
Leave them alone, Mr. Creel.

473
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,020
我们有更加重要的事要商讨
We have far more important things to discuss.

474
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,590
-我是不是在哪见过你  -我叫蕾娜
- I know you from somewhere? - My name is Raina,

475
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,110
我久仰您的大名
and I'm a huge admirer of yours...

476
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,500
以及您的天赋
and your gifts.

477
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,050
走开  女士  我对追星族没兴趣
Beat it, lady. I'm not into groupies.

478
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,290
您误会了
You misunderstand.

479
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,640
我知道您最近获得了
I know you recently acquired

480
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,740
一极其珍贵少见的物件
something extremely precious and rare --

481
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,250
我对此物非常感兴趣
Something I'm very interested in.

482
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,400
不管你开什么价  都不够
Whatever you're offering... it ain't enough.

483
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,720
也许吧
Maybe not.

484
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
但您一点也不好奇
But aren't you the least bit curious

485
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,180
我会提供些什么
as to what it might be?

486
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,160
这个叫卡拜
It's called Carbyn

487
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,990
在星尘中找到的一种碳同位素异构体
an allotrope of carbon found in stardust,

488
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,750
比钻石坚硬三倍
three times harder than diamond...

489
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,720
它还一个额外的好处
With an added bonus.

490
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,460
可以储存能量
It can store energy.

491
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,480
很漂亮  不是吗
Beautiful, isn't it?

492
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,270
充满了潜能
So filled with potential.

493
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,510
我应该对此而心动吗
Am I supposed to be impressed?

494
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,710
您能感兴趣  我就满足了
I'll settle for interested.

495
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,630
你根本不知道你在和谁打交道  女士
You have no idea who you're dealing with, lady.

496
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,670
听说过九头蛇吗
You ever hear of Hydra?

497
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,340
有点耳熟
Name rings a bell.

498
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,190
给你点小提示  赶快跑吧
Let me give you a tip -- run.

499
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,160
因为如果我的老板抓到你
'Cause if the guy I'm working for gets ahold of you,

500
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,840
我不想看到他
I'd hate to see what he's gonna do

501
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,560
折磨这张美丽的小脸蛋
to that pretty little face of yours.

502
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,270
看来您需要些帮助  克里尔先生
Looks like you need some help there, Mr. Creel.

503
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,480
我不是唯一需要帮助的人  女士
I'm not the one who needs help, lady.

504
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,830
如果您碰了方尖碑  就会需要
You do if you touched the obelisk.

505
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,690
告诉你  听清楚了
I'll tell you what -- I'm gonna do you a solid

506
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,210
我不会向我老板告发你
and not tell my boss about you!

507
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,490
你拿卡拜干什么
What about the carbyne?

508
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,050
这是跟我做交易的代价
It's the cost of doing business.

509
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,710
他跑不远
He couldn't have gone far.

510
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,310
地方当局知道他的长相
Local authorities have his description.

511
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,390
进行了道路封锁
Roadblocks are up.

512
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,830
塔伯特的人还在外面
Talbot's people are still out there.

513
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,110
克里尔去酒吧干什么
Why was Creel at the bar?

514
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,680
他在等什么人
He was waiting for someone.

515
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,230
只是不知道那人来了没有
We just don't know if that person ever showed.

516
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,770
我们要找到应对克里尔超能力的办法
We need a solve for Creel's powers.

517
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,850
昨天就应该找到  实验室有结果了吗
And we need it yesterday. How's the lab coming?

518
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,850
还没有
Nothing yet.

519
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,310
还记得我们捣毁了的九头蛇加密频率吗
You remember that encrypted Hydra frequency we shut down?

520
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,750
又回来了
Well, it's back up.

521
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,530
有人发了消息
Someone sent a message.

522
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,180
让我们打这个电话
A message for us with a phone number to call.

523
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,280
可能是卡里尔
Yeah, could be Creel.

524
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,020
卡里尔  电话  他寂寞了吗
Creel? A phone number? What, is he lonely?

525
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,410
深表怀疑  这家伙是肌肉男
I doubt it. The guy is jacked.

526
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,640
还能把身体任意部位变成任何材质
And he can turn any body part into any material.

527
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,180
好了  谢谢提醒
Okay. Thank you for that. Yeah.

528
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,830
-接通这个号码  -明白
- Call the number.  - Okay.

529
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,480
接通中

530
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,180
你好
Hello?

531
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,400
你是谁
Who is this?

532
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,650
科尔森特工  很高兴你收到了我的消息
Agent Coulson, I'm glad you got my message.

533
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,930
蕾娜  真没想到
Raina, as I live and breathe.

534
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,590
咱们好久没聊天了
It's been a while since we've spoken.

535
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,400
我现在还有人要追查  能长话短说吗
I'm kind of in the middle of a manhunt. Can we make this quick?

536
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,040
为什么呢  你需要时间追踪这个号码不是吗
Why? You need time to trace this call, don't you?

537
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:42,840
据我了解
I take it, then,

538
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
你还没找到克里尔  也没找到他偷的东西
you haven't tracked down Mr. Creel or the item he stole.

539
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,950
你知道些什么
What do you know about that?

540
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,060
我知道九头蛇准备插手此事
I know Hydra's about to get their hands on it.

541
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,370
那要恭喜你了
Well, congratulations.

542
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,370
我说清楚
Let me be clear.

543
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,820
克里尔替九头蛇办事  而我没有
Mr. Creel is working for Hydra. I am not.

544
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,530
怎么闹掰了呢  牙齿医保不合心意吗
Why the breakup? Bad dental plan?

545
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,970
九头蛇满脑子只有一件事
Hydra only has one thing on their minds --

546
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,240
统治世界
world domination...

547
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,760
好过时
Which is so 1945.

548
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,960
你想要什么  蕾娜
What do you want, Raina?

549
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,390
应该是我不想要什么
It's what I don't want,

550
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,250
我不想方尖碑落到
which is the Obelisk falling into the hands

551
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,900
不懂它的人手上
of people who don't understand it.

552
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,650
我觉得你可能懂
I'm thinking you might.

553
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,560
我觉得你要告诉我原因
And I'm thinking you're gonna tell me why.

554
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,210
约翰・加勒特知道
John Garrett understood it.

555
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,450
从他被注射
The moment he was injected

556
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,110
曾救过你的那种药物开始
with the same drug that saved you,

557
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,220
他就有了预见力
he had visions.

558
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,590
他开始把预见的幻象刻在墙上
He started carving those visions on the walls.

559
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,340
加勒特是个疯子
Garrett was a madman.

560
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,000
加勒特是被启迪了
Garrett was enlightened.

561
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,390
他看见了我们的命运  看见我们的未来
He witnessed our fate... what we'd become.

562
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,800
你呢
Have you?

563
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,380
你打电话来不是要讨论命运的吧
You're not calling to talk about fate.

564
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,420
你想我们抓住克里尔
You want us to catch Creel.

565
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,670
被你看穿了  科尔森特工
You read my mind, agent Coulson.

566
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,180
事实上克里尔偷了我的东西
Truth is Mr. Creel stole something from me.

567
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,750
好在那东西里装了跟踪器
Fortunately for the both of us, it has an embedded tracker.

568
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,160
不过你得快点
But you'd better hurry.

569
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,750
他越来越不稳定了
He's growing less stable by the second.

570
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,870
频率一旦成功接通
The second that frequency comes through,

571
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,100
我要所有人行动
I want everyone on the move.

572
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,910
如果克里尔把东西交给九头蛇
If Creel's handing off the item to Hydra,

573
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,030
我们得观察接下来事情的走向
we need to see where that leads.

574
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,250
如果克里尔又发作了呢
What if Creel melts down again?

575
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,500
实验室还没研究出怎么对付他的能力
The lab hasn't figured out how to shut down his powers yet.

576
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,090
如果他威胁到了普通人
If he's an immediate threat to civilians,

577
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,420
执行崔普的后备计划
Trip's got the backup plan.

578
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,770
什么样的后备计划
What kind of backup plan?

579
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,590
重型机械装载穿甲子弹那种
The heavy-duty kind with armor-piercing rounds.

580
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,930
这能行吗
Will that work?

581
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,790
尽量靠近他  趁他不防备...
Get close enough to him, catch him off guard...

582
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,210
希望我们不用到这一步
Hopefully, we won't have to find out.

583
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,200
需要我做什么
Where do you want me?

584
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,180
看情况  你能遵守命令吗
That depends. Can you follow an order?

585
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,470
必须的  长官
Absolutely, sir.

586
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,560
因为我一方面想让你留在后方
Because part of me wants you here running back-end.

587
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,550
另一方面我知道前线需要人手
The other part knows we need boots on the ground,

588
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,890
而我手里好牌又不多
and I've only got a few good pairs.

589
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,480
我不会捣乱的  以童子军之名发誓
I'll be good. Scout's honor.

590
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,390
求你了  长官  这是我欠哈特利
Please, sir. I owe Hartley one.

591
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,130
他能帮得上忙
We could use him.

592
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,080
准备好
Suit up.

593
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,230
关键就在于
It's all about the...

594
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,080
共振
the resonant.

595
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,280
我今天没解决问题
I didn't solve this today.

596
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,510
这是什么
What -- what -- what -- what is this?

597
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,070
是跟声波有关吗
What, is this some kind of sonic thing,

598
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,780
-就跟隐身装置一样吗  -不  我没有
- like the cloaking device? - No, I didn't, uh...

599
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,540
别去想隐身装置了  好吗
Look, forget about the cloaking device, all right?

600
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,120
没人会因为那个怪你
No one's blaming you for that.

601
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,620
如今我们要关注的是如何制服克里尔
Right now we just got to focus on taking down Creel.

602
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,300
别激动  冷静点
Whoa! Whoa! Calm the hell down!

603
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,540
都滚开  你们惹到他了
Hey, beat it! You're pissing him off.

604
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,070
-好吧  -冷静下来
- Okay. - Take it easy.

605
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,170
-我今天没解决问题  -我知道
- Look, I didn't solve this today! - Yeah, I know.

606
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,290
你已经说过了
You said that already!

607
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,670
我今天没解决问题
I didn't solve this today!

608
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,210
等等  你是说你今天没能解决
Wait. Are you saying you didn't solve this today.

609
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,740
但你以前解决过
You solved this before?

610
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,270
没错
Yes.

611
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,780
你是要找以前的设计吗
Y-you're looking for an old design?

612
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,620
没错
Yes!

613
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,070
-就是这样  -好吧
- Yeah. Yeah. - All right. Okay.

614
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,240
别着急  我帮你
All right. I'm with you.

615
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,480
我帮你  糊涂虫  别着急
Yeah. I'm with you, turbo. All right.

616
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,190
不是这个
No.

617
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,160
不是这个
No.

618
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,780
也不是这个
No.

619
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,960
往回倒  之前的那一个
Um...go back one. Go back one.

620
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,110
就是这个
Yeah.

621
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,810
就是这个
Yeah!

622
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,130
冰冻枪
Icers?

623
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,700
太好了  为什么我们不能使用致命武器
Great. How did we get stuck with a nonlethal option?

624
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,860
扔硬币决定的  崔普选了反面
Coin flip. Trip called tails.

625
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,750
实验室刚来了消息
Just getting word from the lab.

626
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,030
菲兹或许能给我们提供一样设备
Fitz might have something we can use

627
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,610
来解除克里尔的能力
to neutralize Creel's power.

628
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,200
这是今天最好的消息了
Best news we've had all day.

629
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,880
蕾娜的追踪器刚刚上线  克里尔在这里
Raina's tracker just popped. Creel's here.

630
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,250
崔普  你就位了吗
Trip, are you in position?

631
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,110
我到位了  枪已上膛  正在寻找
Locked, loaded, and looking...

632
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,530
锁定目标  物品在他手上
found him. He's got the package.

633
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,260
看上去克里尔正在跟背对着他的男人说话
Looks like Creel is talking to the guy with his back to him.

634
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,790
那是他九头蛇的联络人
That's his Hydra contact.

635
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,560
交易随时可能进行  斯凯
The deal's going down. Skye?

636
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,200
正在运行面部识别
Running facial recognition now.

637
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,410
来看看这家伙叫什么
Let's put a name to that face.

638
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,920
让交易进行
Let the exchange happen.

639
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,680
斯凯和亨特跟着新目标  梅  继续监视克里尔
Skye and Hunter, follow the new player. May, stay with Creel.

640
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,630
都听清了吗
Everyone copy?

641
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,060
-收到  -收到
- Copy that. - Copy.

642
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,640
收到  长官
Copy that, sir.

643
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,500
物品还在他手上
The package is still in place.

644
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,020
为什么克里尔还不进行交易
Wonder why Creel hasn't made the exchange yet.

645
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,050
能监听到他在说什么吗
Can we get a laser mike on him?

646
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,720
斯凯  能听见吗
Skye, you copy?

647
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,580
斯凯
Skye?

648
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
不是吧
Oh, hell no.

649
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,640
你没听我说
You're not listening.

650
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,580
这东西已经蔓延全身  我无法控制了
It's spreading all over. I can barely contain it.

651
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,090
把东西给我  我就帮你
Pass me the case and I'll help you.

652
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,990
帮我  否则你的下场就会跟那个女侍应生一样
Help me, and I won't do to you what I did to the waitress.

653
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,760
别激动  克里尔先生
Calm down, Mr. Creel.

654
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,610
深呼吸  好好想清楚
Take a deep breath and clear your mind.

655
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,360
记住你接受的训练
Remember your training.

656
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,500
记住  服从会得到奖励
Remember, compliance will be rewarded.

657
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,430
我很乐意服从
I'm happy to comply.

658
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,170
好  很好
Good. Very good.

659
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,110
他有枪
He's got a gun

660
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,880
天呐
Oh, my god!

661
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,780
都出去  快
Everybody out! Move!

662
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,190
我不会骗你  哥们
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, pal.

663
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,880
这会很疼
This is really gonna hurt.

664
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,140
以童子军之名发誓
"Scout's honor"?

665
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,190
你就不是童子军吧
You were never a boy scout, were you?

666
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,240
敬礼
Present! Huh!

667
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,650
礼毕
Order! Huh!

668
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,410
现在还偷起车来了
Breaking into cars now?

669
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,720
只是在兑现我的承诺
Following up on a promise.

670
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
多亏了你
Thanks to you.

671
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,820
不是只有塔伯特准将有朋友
General Talbot's not the only one with friends,

672
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,650
不过抱歉  你想要的200万美金
though I am sorry about that $2 million you wanted.

673
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,760
我可没办法给你
That I can't swing.

674
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,300
那个你也知道
Oh, you knew about that, too, eh?

675
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,200
毕竟我是神盾局的局长
I'm the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

676
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,960
真是棒极了  塔伯特想要我的命
Well, that's just marvelous. Talbot wants me dead.

677
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,580
现在我逃命的盘缠也没了
And now I have no funds to run with.

678
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,620
-有什么建议吗  -有
- Any tips? - Yeah.

679
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,700
别逃了  到我这来吧
Don't run. Work for me instead.

680
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,610
克里尔肯定给你的脑袋来了一下
Creel must have hit you in the head.

681
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,110
我射伤了你三名特工
I shot three of your agents.

682
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,680
包括梅特工  可不是明智之举
Including Agent may. Not a smart move.

683
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,590
她记仇吗
She the type that holds a grudge?

684
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,670
应该说是享受
Savors it, actually.

685
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,340
你确实犯了错
No doubt, you've made some mistakes.

686
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,520
我也犯过  比如让你去抓克里尔
So have I, like letting you go after Creel.

687
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,010
但我理解你的心情
But I felt for you.

688
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,410
所以我利用了那一点
Yeah, and I took advantage of that.

689
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,740
你怎么知道我不会再犯
How do you know I won't do it again?

690
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,030
我不知道  但现实情况是
I don't, but the reality is

691
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,850
我手上没有直升航母或昆式战斗机的舰队
I don't have a fleet of helicarriers or quinjets

692
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,530
也没有数千的特工可以调遣
or thousands of agents at my disposal anymore.

693
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,070
还有拳王炙烤炉就已经很幸运了
We're lucky we still have our George Foreman Grill.

694
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,980
你需要人手  是吗
You need warm bodies. Is that it?

695
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,650
我们需要有能力的人才出外勤
I need skilled assets in the field

696
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,320
为了任务愿意越界
who are willing to step over the line,

697
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,510
为对的事  做错的事
to do the wrong thing but for the right reason.

698
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,140
我需要你是因为我成不了你
I need you because I can't be you.

699
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,410
再也成不了了
Not anymore.

700
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,360
那样挺好  相信我
Yeah, well, you're better off. Trust me.

701
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,120
选择权在你手上
Look, it's your choice.

702
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,870
但我尊敬的好人
But good people... people I respect...

703
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,480
为你做了担保
vouched for you.

704
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,360
我想知道为什么
I'd like to find out why.

705
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,680
我怎么知道
Hell if I know.

706
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,080
但我很好奇
But I'm curious.

707
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,330
那就足够了
Good enough.

708
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,090
我需要你做件事
I just need you to do one thing.

709
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,530
什么事
Oh, yeah?

710
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,280
出卖我
Sell me out.

711
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,160
声波破坏了分子结构的...
The sound waves disrupted the molecular, um...

712
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,450
分子结构的...
the molecular -- the, um...

713
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,310
你该明白的  是你改良了它
Well, you should understand. You modified it.

714
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,540
有些人听曲子就能演奏出来
You know how some guys can play a tune by ear?

715
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,000
可我需要乐谱
Well, I need sheet music.

716
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,130
这个原始版本...
The original one...

717
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,740
是你和我一直听说的西蒙斯特工
you built this with this Agent Simmons

718
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,730
一起做出来的吗
I keep hearing about?

719
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,440
对  西蒙斯怎么了
Yeah. What about Simmons?

720
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,120
没什么  我听说她很不错
Oh, no, no. I heard that she was cool.

721
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,490
听说你们俩很亲密
Heard that you two were pretty tight.

722
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,230
是啊
Yeah.

723
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,580
失去一个好搭档让人很难受
It's tough to lose a good partner.

724
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,540
她离开后你怎么样
How you been holding up since she left?

725
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,100
还好
I'm okay.

726
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,610
他能和别人说说话我很高兴
I'm glad he's talking to someone.

727
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,180
我得承认我自己都不太好受
I've got to admit, I'm having a tough time with it.

728
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,500
可以理解
It's understandable.

729
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,000
他变了
He's changed.

730
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,780
我们都变了  局长也是
We all have. Even the director.

731
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,160
科尔森有很多事要忙  他要重建神盾局
Coulson has a lot on his plate, rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.

732
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,730
这我就不知道了
I wouldn't know.

733
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,990
这段时间  他不太乐意分享
He's not exactly the sharing type these days.

734
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,370
他要操心不只是我们或者团队
He has the world to worry about,

735
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,630
还有整个世界
not just us, not just the team.

736
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,840
不是这样的  梅
That's not it, May.

737
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,920
我观察他好几个月了
I've been watching him for months,

738
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,490
我知道他有事瞒着我
and I know he's keeping something from me,

739
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,040
不只是因为他是神盾局的局长
and it's not just because he's the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

740
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,430
我觉得他出事了
I think something is wrong with him.

741
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,220
斯凯.
Skye.

742
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,350
不  说真的  梅
No, May, be honest.

743
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,130
科尔森没事吗
Is Coulson okay?

744
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,450
当然
Of course.

745
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,420
你到底怎么了
What is wrong with you?

746
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,110
你现在是局长  不是什么一级外勤特工
You're director now, not some level 1 field agent.

747
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,500
没什么级别了  我把这项制度废除了
There are no levels anymore. I got rid of those.

748
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,640
你本来就不该出外勤的
You never should have gone into the field like that.

749
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,690
不用谢
You're welcome.

750
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,840
不好笑  菲尔
It's not funny, Phil.

751
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,140
我了解你
I know you.

752
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,700
我知道你什么时候压力过大
And I know when you're overly stressed.

753
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,360
你上一次已经是18天前了
It's been 18 days since your last episode.

754
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,980
-17天  -就是18天
- 17. - 18.

755
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,980
这意味着你又要来一次
Which means you're due or another one.

756
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,850
已经过了
Overdue.

757
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,620
我也是忍累了
And I'm tired of fighting it.

758
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,690
那就别忍
So don't.

759
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,460
我就是来帮你的
That's why I'm here.

760
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,550
干得漂亮
You did well.

761
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,720
谢谢你
Thank you.

762
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,780
-我  -现在  把它拿起来
- I -- - Now...pick it up.

763
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,130
你
You...

764
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,720
-你想要我  -我想知道
- You want me -- - I need to know.

765
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,300
你也想
So do you.

766
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,260
拿起来
Pick it up.

767
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,600
起作用了
It worked.

768
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,370
不是
No.

769
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,830
它放过你了
It let you live.

770
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,550
这两者是有区别的
There's a difference.

771
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,670
让我看看  求您了
Show me. Please.

772
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,380
带我女儿来
Bring me my daughter,

773
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,910
我秀给你俩看
and I'll show the both of you.

774
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,600
格伦
Glenn.

775
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,870
我能叫你"格伦"吗
Can I call you "Glenn"?

776
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,780
不能
No.

777
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,670
亨特在哪
Where's Hunter?

778
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,100
大概在看《蛋糕天王》[电视节目]
Watching "Cake Boss," I believe.

779
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,800
抱歉  我把你们的交易条款给改了
Sorry. I changed the terms of your deal.

780
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,480
那他还是履约了
Well, he kept up his end.

781
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,090
你这不来了么  问题是  你来干什么
You're here. Question is why?

782
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,970
绑架你我很过意不去
I felt bad for kidnapping you,

783
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,110
所以我带了点礼物来求和解
so I brought you a peace offering.

784
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,410
卡尔・克里尔
Carl Creel.

785
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,450
我还以为克里尔死了
I thought Creel was dead.

786
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,860
他是变成石头了  但他以前也行
He's turned to stone, but he could always do that,

787
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,750
所以我也不知道能维持多久
so I'm not sure how long it'll hold.

788
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,510
我把他关在货车后面的
I've got him in a cryostasis chamber

789
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,780
冷冻舱里  估计再过58分钟
in the back of the van for 58 more minutes

790
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,000
就没电了
before the juice runs out.

791
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,760
我觉得该把他尽快关进戒备森严的地方
I'd get him someplace secure pretty quick.

792
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,310
最好比之前的地方再森严一点
Maybe a little more secure than last time.

793
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,250
就是建议一下
Just saying.

794
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,430
你还真是慷慨啊
Very generous of you.

795
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,600
就像我上次跟你说的  将军  我们是好人
Like I told you before, General, we're the good guys.

796
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,560
我们不如做笔交易吧
So, how about we make a deal?

797
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,060
神盾局照旧把这类厚礼处理给你
S.H.I.E.L.D. will keep dropping off presents like this,

798
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
你照旧邀功晋职
you keep getting promoted.

799
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,760
我们只希望你们不要逼得太紧
All we ask for in return is a little breathing room.

800
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,220
听起来不错吧
Sound good?

801
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,080
你啊你
You...

802
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,790
你胆子也真大  科尔森
You must have some big brass ones, Coulson.

803
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,660
孤身一人就敢来见我
Coming out here by yourself to meet me...

804
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,150
还面对面  连支援都不带
Face-to-face, no backup.

805
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,060
咱们把话说开了吧
Let's face facts.

806
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,400
你和你那一小队怪胎撑不起神盾局的名号
You and your little band of misfits are hardly S.H.I.E.L.D.

807
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,920
我们的情报显示  就你手上这点人力物力
Our intel says you don't have enough manpower or artillery

808
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,050
攻下个便利店都够呛  所以抱歉了
to take down a convenience store, so I'm sorry.

809
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,780
我得拒绝你的提议了
I'm gonna have to say no to that deal.

810
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,970
不对吧
I don't know...

811
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,700
我觉得我们物力挺足的
I think we're good on artillery.

812
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
为免你动什么歪心思  准将
In case you get any ideas, General,

813
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,080
这还只是冰山一角
that's just a tip of the iceberg.

814
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,730
咱们赶紧撤  不然冰山快没油了
Let's get out of here before the iceberg runs out of fuel.

815
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,360
见见亨利・摩根医生  接下来  《永恒》
Meet Dr. Henry Morgan, Forever next.

816
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,030
你愿意配合了吗
Are you ready to comply?

817
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,260
下周二
Next Tuesday...

818
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,980
我受够了让九头蛇夺走我们最优秀的人才了
I'm getting tired of losing our best and brightest to Hydra.

819
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,350
恶人即将登场
For the bad guys...

820
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,650
不许留活口
No one leaves here alive.

821
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,200
是时候招兵买马了
It's recruitment time.

822
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,030
我知道我为谁工作
I'm well aware of whom I work for.

823
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,590
而他们的主要目标
And top of their list...

824
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,190
就是神盾局特工们
are the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

825
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,720
你到底是哪边的
Which side are you end up on?

826
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,530
你以为我发现不了吗
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

827
