这座城市仍然需要拯救

15
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,430
不由兜帽男
Not by the hood.

16
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,410
需要一个英雄
It needs a hero.

17
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,900
如果你通过了严酷的考验  你会因此而强大

18
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,240

莎拉对刺客联盟宣誓了忠诚

21
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,170

- You agreed to go back.? - She'll be ok.

22
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,240
我知道她没事  
Yeah, I know she'll be ok,

23
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,280
但我担心的就是她哪方面没事
but ok what is what bothers me.

24
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,730
爸爸  爸爸

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,920
斯莱德的整个计划就是要夺走我的一切  他做到了
Slade's whole plan was to take everything from me. He did.

26
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,100
斯莱德把劳蕾尔抓去  
Slade took Laurel

27
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,390
因为他要杀掉我心爱的女人
because he wants to kill the woman I love.

28
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,410
-所以呢  -所以他抓错人了

我并非一直待在岛上

32
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,520
我是阿曼达·沃勒  奎恩先生

约翰  有一批装载非法火箭筒的车辆
John, there's an illegal shipment of rpgs

38
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,940
往你的方向开去

39
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,730
收到  我这就去
Roger. I'm on it.

所以的确是收到
Oh, so it is roger.

41
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,930
火箭筒安全  我看到了

文森特·斯蒂尔格雷夫
Vincent Steelgrave...

45
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,290
你辜负了这座城市
You have failed this city.

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,350
{\an8}危险  禁止进入

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,870
绿箭刚除掉了另一个
The Arrow just took down another one

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,410
城市头号通缉犯
of the city's most wanted,

49
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,460
无可否认  过去五个月里
and there's no denying that the city's crime rate

50
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,410
城市的犯罪率直线下降
has plummeted in the past five months.

51
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,190
-不客气  -而且失业率下降
- You're welcome. - But so has its unemployment rate

52
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,680
人口减少
and its population.

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,990
到目前为止  我们经历了两次恐怖袭击
We have experienced two terrorist attacks in as many years.

54
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,650
星城即将死去  满是罪犯的监狱...
Starling City is dying, and a prison full of criminals--

55
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,950
又干掉一个
Take another off the board.

56
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,340
我们保持如此  星城
We keep this up, there will only be

57
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,450
就会只剩两种罪犯了
two types of criminals left in Starling City--

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,830
我们绳之以法的
the ones we put away

59
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,050
和闻风奔命的
and the ones that are running scared.

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,560
那是什么
What's that?

61
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,640
蕨类植物  它靠光线生长
A fern. It thrives on the light.

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,980
我想既然你现在住在这里了
I thought since you were living here now,

63
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,920
这地方可以美化一下
the place could do with a little sprucing.

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,240
我是让你给我买张床
I let you buy me a bed.

65
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,740
你睡在地板上
You were sleeping on the floor.

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,440
西娅又来短信了
Another text from Thea.

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,650
她现在在哪里
Where is she now?

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,120
阿马尔菲海岸
Amalfi Coast.

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,560
我一直让她发照片过来
I keep telling her to send photos.

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,750
我要出去巡逻  清醒一下
I'm going to go do a patrol, clear my head.

71
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,230
你今晚表现很棒
You did really good tonight.

72
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,020
我也要出去了
I'm going to head out, too.

73
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,340
我今天得上早班
I have to pull an early shift at work today,

74
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,030
这可能是  也可能不是我说过的最令人沮丧的话
which may or may not be the most depressing thing I've ever said.

75
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,730
明晚我们还继续吧
But we're still on for tomorrow night?

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,590
绝对的  我要把你变成
Absolutely. I am going to turn you

77
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,830
公司的主宰
into corporate master of the universe.

78
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,350
那些董事会成员肯定会恳求
Those board members are going to be begging

79
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,890
把奎恩联合企业卖给你和你的支持者
to sell Queen Consolidated back to you and your backers.

80
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,090
我也要走了
I'm going to roll out, too.

81
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,010
莱拉让我努力做那个麻烦的摇篮
Lyla has me trying to build the bassinet from hell.

82
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,380
那提醒了我...
That reminds me...

83
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,980
我想着既然你和莱拉有了女儿...
I figured since you and Lyla are having a girl...

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,160
你买不起的
Man, you cannot afford this.

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,710
我什么都买不起  所以我才亲手做了
I can't afford anything, which is why I made it.

86
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,410
箭头  我能做的为数不多的几样东西之一
Arrowheads, one of the few things that I can make.

87
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,500
很漂亮  谢谢
Well, it's beautiful. Thank you.

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,820
恭喜  约翰
Congratulations, John.

89
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,720
不仅仅是因为孩子
And not just on the baby.

90
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,390
你和莱拉很快乐
You and Lyla are happy.

91
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,050
你有空也该试试
Well, you know, you should try it some time.

92
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,640
前任加入了刺客联盟
Last girlfriend, she's in the League of Assassins.

93
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,010
上上任开枪打了上上上任
My girlfriend before that, she shot my girlfriend before that.

94
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,090
我目前可不怎么讨人喜欢
I'm not...not exactly a catch at the moment.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,490
也许费利西蒂会改变那一切
Maybe Felicity will change all that.

96
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,880
现在不合适
It's...it's not the right time.

97
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,280
现在就是合适的时机  奥利弗
Things are as good now as ever will be, Oliver.

98
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,100
而且你爱她
And you love her.

99
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,590
你甚至都跟她说了
You even told her so.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
我那是想骗斯莱德
I was trying to fool Slade.

101
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,810
是啊
Yes.

102
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,970
只不过现在你唯一骗的就是自己
Except now the only person you're fooling is yourself.

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,100
再次感谢
Thanks again.

104
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,720
{\an8}五年前

105
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,540
{\an8}妈妈  我还活着

106
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,830
{\an8}我在香港

107
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,930
我跟你说了  我不说中文
I told you, I don't speak Chinese!

108
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,970
我也跟你说了  你再想着逃跑
And I told you, you try to escape again,

109
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,150
我就打晕你
I beat you senseless.

110
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,290
{\an8}狱政局

111
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,580
斯蒂尔格雷请求判十五至二十年
Steelgrave took a plea for 15 to 20.

112
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,350
{\an8}星城法院

113
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,250
在我把绿箭收集的证据亮出来以后
His lawyer folded like a deck chair

114
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,670
他的律师就萎靡不振了
after I hit him with the evidence that the Arrow gathered.

115
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,820
干得好
Good work.

116
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,460
你负责抓人  我负责治他们
You catch 'em, I cook 'em.

117
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,650
我是不是说得太大声了
Did I say that too loud?

118
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,230
没有
No, you're fine.

119
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,530
你有想过我们会合作吗
Did you ever think that we'd end up as business partners?

120
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,880
这就是你邀请我来的原因吗  劳蕾尔
Is that why you invited me down here, Laurel?

121
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,900
亲眼看着斯蒂尔格雷被送去坐牢
To see Mr. Steelgrave sent off into his new life?

122
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,500
不是
No.

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
我要给你个惊喜
I have a surprise for you.

124
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,800
你爸爸在这干什么
What's your dad doing here?

125
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,980
一会你就知道了
You'll see.

126
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,620
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

127
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,480
老爸
Dad.

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,250
你怎么样
How are you?

129
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,880
要是他们告诉我升职要开新闻发布会
Well, if they had told me press conferences came with a promotion,

130
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,940
那我宁愿还是挨一枪
I would tell them I prefer getting shot at.

131
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,320
好在你的医生没有给你选择
Good thing your doctors didn't give you a choice, then.

132
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,050
虽然你很高兴我再也不能出外勤了
You know, you could try to hide the fact

133
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,430
但至少也该掩饰一下
that you're glad I can't get out in the field anymore.

134
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,200
令我高兴的是你安然无恙
I can't hide that I'm glad that you're safe.

135
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,080
-这是怎么回事  -这是给你的惊喜
- What's all this? - Your surprise.

136
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,790
谢谢大家  谢谢你们能来
Thank you all, thank you for coming.

137
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,090
五个月前  这个城市陷入危机
Five months ago, this city was under siege.

138
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,700
星城的警察们团结在兜帽男周围
And the SCPD rallied behind a man in a hood.

139
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,900
现在我升为了警监
Well, I ended up with a captain's rank,

140
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,970
而他连一句谢谢都没有得到
and he didn't even get a thank you.

141
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,600
但今天  他会受到感谢
But today, he does.

142
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,490
因为今天星城警局正式承认
'Cause today, the Starling City Police Department

143
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,010
这个被称为绿箭的人的合法身份
is formally recognizing the individual known as the Arrow.

144
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,070
并且我以我的新职位宣布
And I'm using my new position

145
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,130
解散
to disband

146
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,880
负责抓捕治安维护者的小组
the Anti-vigilante Task Force charged with capturing him.

147
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,850
谢谢
Thank you.

148
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,220
但不要误会  我们不会纵容私自执法
Now make no mistake-- vigilantism will never be tolerated.

149
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,300
但我拒绝以城市的名义追捕
But I refuse to hunt, in the name of this city,

150
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,020
{\an8}法院广场现场直播

151
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,660
-这位拯救了城市的英雄  -把这玩意关掉
- the hero who saved it. - Shut that crap off.

152
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,120
他们不抓绿箭意味着要抓我们了
Less heat on the Arrow means more heat on us.

153
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,130
烟酒和火器管理局扣了我们的榴弹发射器
And the ATF now has our shipment of grenade launchers.

154
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,160
他们已经把我们的货截了
They got our shipment already?

155
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,280
那我们还向警察行贿干什么
What are we paying bribes to the cops for?

156
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,900
我们还有一个更紧迫的问题
We have a more pressing concern.

157
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,090
缺乏领导
Lack of leadership.

158
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,730
我举荐我自己  有反对的吗
I nominate myself. Any objections?

159
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,200
是的  不少
Yeah, a few.

160
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,170
那你说说吧
Illuminate me.

161
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,660
从哪开始  不光是因为你说话好笑
Where do I start? It's not just that you talk funny.

162
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,330
你根本就不会做生意
You don't know the first thing about business.

163
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,890
你只是个街头卖毒品的小混混
You're just a low level street dealer, a pill pusher.

164
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,020
我卖的那些毒品
Those pills I push?

165
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,950
名字叫"迷魂"
Are known as Vertigo.

166
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,100
我仿效"伯爵"
In the wake of the Count,

167
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,680
修改了一下他的配方
I tinkered some with his formula,

168
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,630
添加了某种蘑菇产出的添加剂
introduced an additive produced by certain mushrooms.

169
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,620
我造的"迷魂"让你看到你最害怕的形象
My Vertigo reveals the face of your greatest fear.

170
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,920
我刚才说了
As I was saying...

171
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,310
你们缺乏领导  我举荐我自己
lack of leadership. I nominate myself.

172
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,170
有反对的吗
Any objections?

173
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,740
我们的做法简单明了
Our course of action is straight as an arrow.

174
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,340
先生们
Gentlemen...

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
我们要杀了绿箭
we're going to kill him.

176
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,540
{\an8}威登酒吧

177
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,090
工作得怎么样
How was work?

178
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,940
那不是工作  那简直是折磨自己的灵魂
"It" is not work. It is a soul crushing exercise in misery

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,550
出卖健康  简单来说
that offers health and dental. Suffice it to say,

180
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,340
我非常积极地
I am highly motivated

181
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,840
说服董事会把公司卖回给你
to help convince the board to sell you back the company.

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
但不幸的是  你不够资格
Unfortunately, you don't really have

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,760
来管理奎恩联合企业
the qualifications to run Queen Consolidated,

184
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,460
不过你有激情
But what you do have is passion.

185
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,130
你关心公司  也关心公司的员工
You care about the company and the people that work there.

186
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,480
所以你要让他们理解你
That's what you have to get across to them.

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,780
要发自内心地说出你的想法
You got to speak from the heart.

188
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,170
费利西蒂
Felicity...

189
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,530
你愿意跟我一起吃晚饭吗

190
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,180
-我在说正事呢  奥利弗  -我也是
- I'm being serious here, Oliver. - So am I.

191
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,550
我是不是想多了
I don't want to read... too much into this,

192
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,610
你这是在约我出去吗
but are you asking me out on a date?

193
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,790
就像约会  真正的约会
Like an actual date? Like a... date-date?

194
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,420
我是说  跟你吃饭  就是...
Su--I mean, the implication being with dinner that you...

195
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,200
通常都是我  语不成句
Usually I'm the one talking in sentence fragments.

196
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,400
你愿意跟我一起吃晚饭吗
Would you like to go to dinner with me?

197

我能请你们稍等一会儿吗

有人打电话来寻求技术支持

207

你让我被炒定鱿鱼了

208
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,340
好吧  我黑进了市里的数据库

找到他了  他在下水道里

我在地下搜到了他的手机信号

他在格兰德路和埃姆斯路的转角处

225
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,260
你已经做得够多了
You've already done more than enough.

226
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,400
我得走了  得去个地方
I've got to go. Some place I have to be.

227
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,470
你是有个什么燃情约会吗
You got a hot date or something?

228
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,480
所以今天早上是你五个月以来
So this morning makes how many escape attempts

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,010
第几次试图逃跑了

230
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,920
第九次
Nine.

231
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,590
我们现在的问题是不能互相理解
What we have here is a failure to reach an understanding.

232
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,070
去死吧
Go to hell.

233
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,240
这就是我把你从炼狱的海边救回来
So this is my reward from saving you from drowning

234
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,630
不让你溺死在那艘货船上的回报吗
in that freighter off the coast of Lian Yu?

235
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,240
没错
Yeah.

236
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,670
你为什么要救我
Why'd you do that?

237
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,340
你得明白这一点
That's need to know.

238
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,380
姑且说  我需要一个有你这种能力的人
Suffice it to say, I have need of a man of your capacity.

239
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,730
我不在乎
I don't care.

240
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,610
除了回家  我什么也不在乎
I don't care about anything except going home.

241
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,270
而你也应该清楚这一点
And you should know that.

242
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,140
你应该清楚
You should know

243
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,120
我不会停止逃跑的
that I will never stop trying to escape.

244
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,890
那你也应该知道
And you should know that

245
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,530
要杀一个全世界都以为他已经死了的人
it's extremely easy to kill someone

246
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,080
也是非常容易的
the world already thinks is dead.

247
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,450
那就杀了我吧
Kill me, then.

248
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,200
我不在乎
I don't care.

249
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,920
看来我们要换一种方式了
We're going to have to try this another way, then.

250
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,940
您好  谢谢您的耐心等候
Hi. Thank you for waiting.

251
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,910
没关系的  我就是想买这个
Ah, no problem. I just want to buy this.

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,760
这是一个TX40型号的卫星频率通讯器

254
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,730
一个洋葱路由保护的防火墙
a TORsecured firewall

255
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,730
{\an8}TOR: The Onion Router 洋葱头表层代理网络

256
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,920
然后需要找东西来帮我入侵
and I need something to help me piggyback off

257
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,930
一个锁眼"六角形"卫星  所以...
a Keyhole Hexagon satellite, so...

258
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,930
{\an8}锁眼卫星: 间谍卫星

259
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,950
我这么干过一次
I did that once.

260
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,520
我黑过一个公共的无线网络信号
Hacked a public wi-fi signal,

261
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,930
用众包的潜行程序入侵的

你是费利西蒂·斯莫克

263
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,010
奎恩集团的前任员工
Formerly of Queen Consolidated.

264
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,720
介意我问一句吗  你为什么会在这里
Do you mind if I ask you something-- why are you here?

265
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,180
你怎么知道我是谁
How do you know who I am?

266
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,840
我认识一个人可能有兴趣
I know a guy who might be interested

267
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,950
雇一个有你这种专业技能的人
in hiring someone with your expertise.

268
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,500
实际上我现在并没有...
I'm not actually...

269
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,610
在找一份新工作  天呐
looking for a new job right now. God help me.

270
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,070
但是我能为您的这次购物服务
But I can help you buy this.

271
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,760
除非我不能  我的意思是  我不应该
Unless I can't. I mean, I shouldn't.

272
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,190
你不应该买这个
You shouldn't buy this.

273
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,800
好吧  显然你不明白
Ok. Clearly you don't understand

274
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,880
买卖销售到底是怎么一回事

我去年见识到了一个
I got to touch one last year.

278
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,460
真是天赐之福
Pure bliss.

279
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,690
而且假如你想要攻破一个洋葱路由级别的安全系统
And if you want to breach TOR-level security,

280
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,410
你真的应该用一个远程管理工具
you should really deploy a remote administration tool.

281
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,730
我有个很好用的  这是链接
I have a good one. Here's the URL.

282
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,690
谢啦
Thanks.

283
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,870
黑客愉快
Happy hacking.

284
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,150
真希望如此
I certainly hope so.

285
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,500
是假警报
False alarm.

286
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,530
你确定吗  这些收缩...
Are you sure? These contractions...

287
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,440
只是假性宫缩
Just braxton-hicks.

288
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
你的宫口扩张连四厘米都不到
You're not even four centimeters dilated.

289
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
我觉得自己像一台M1-A1
I feel like an M1-A1.

290
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,530
是一种坦克
It's a tank.

291
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,270
想象一下一台很大很大的坦克
Think a big, big tank.

292
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,960
你进来住着是正确的选择
You did the right thing coming in.

293
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,130
你不希望你的丈夫...
You don't want your husband--

294
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,660
-男朋友  -前夫
- Boyfriend. - Ex-husband.

295
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,880
在高速公路旁给你接生吧
to be delivering the baby on the side of the freeway.

296
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,540
你现在可以把衣服穿上了
You can get dressed now.

297
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,590
好吧
All right.

298
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,740
你没事吧
Are you ok?

299
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,410
没事  我又不是那个怀胎九月的人
Yeah, yeah, I'm not the one that's nine months pregnant.

300
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,110
你看起来有点被吓到了
You look a little scared.

301
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,060
亲爱的  拜托  我打败过塔利班
Honey, please, I've thrown down with the Taliban,

302
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,160
马尔科姆·梅林  和一个
Malcolm Merlyn, and a host

303
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,530
使用了米拉库鲁技术的人体武器的组织
of Mirakuru-powered human weapons.

304
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,640
我很害怕
I'm terrified.

305
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,930
奎恩  两人桌
Queen, party of two.

306
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,890
这边请
Right this way.

307
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,560
-怎么了  -没事
- What? - Nothing.

308
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,330
-我只是有点...  -紧张
- I'm just- - Nervous?

309
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,870
是啊
Yeah.

310
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,360
想跟你约会的人可多着呢
Line forms behind me.

311
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,550
威士忌  不加冰
Scotch. Neat.

312
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,200
我只要水就好  谢谢
Just the water for me, thanks.

313
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,520
你  你确定吗
Are you--are you sure?

314
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,980
喝点酒也许有助于...
The booze might sort of help with the whole--

315
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,380
酒精跟我服用的三种药
The alcohol is not going

316
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,630
可能产生不良反应
to mix well with the three benzos I took.

317
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,610
我疯了吗
Am I being crazy?

318
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,710
我是说我们有什么好紧张的
I mean, what do we have to be nervous about?

319
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,750
我们已经说光了所有
Well, we've already exhausted every topic

320
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,780
通常应该在第一次约会时说的话题
that one would normally talk about on a first date.

321
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,190
还有第二次约会的话题  第三次的
And a second date and a third date,

322
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,760
其实所有约会的话题都说光了
and every date, actually,

323
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,460
我甚至见过你半身赤裸的样子
And I've already seen you shirtless.

324
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,860
见过好多次了
Multiple times.

325
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,780
半身赤裸  经常的事
Shirtless, all the time.

326
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,590
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

327
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,870
我还有些事是你不知道的
There are still a few things that you don't know about me.

328
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,470
请吧  说一个
Please. Name one.

329
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,870
我离开的那五年
The five years that I was away...

330
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,450
我并不是一直待在炼狱岛
I wasn't always on Lian Yu.

331
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,340
我猜也是
I thought so.

332
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,590
你还去了哪
Where were you?

333
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,870
香港...
Hong Kong...

334
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,860
是其中之一
for one.

335
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,960
我最近总是在想...
And I have been thinking a lot recently about...

336
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,920
自己在那里的经历
my time there.

337
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,600
还有我不得不做出的那些选择
The choices that I had to make.

338
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,070
听起来那些年似乎发生了很多糟糕的事
Those years sound like they were full of a whole lot of suck.

339
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,090
抱歉
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,310
我有点神游
I'm just a little out of my element.

341
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,000
我离开的那段时间
The entire time that I was gone,

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,160
我从来无法
I could never...

343
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,260
完全相信什么人
completely trust someone.

344
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,020
如果那种状态持续得太久了
And when that goes on for so long,

345
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,290
你就不会
you stop...

346
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,610
把人当做人看
seeing people for people.

347
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,860
而是当做
You see...

348
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,590
威胁
threats.

349
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,160
或目标
Or targets.

350
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,910
而我决定回家时  我...
And when I decided to come home, I...

351
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,620
我都不知道该如何摆脱那种思维方式了
I just didn't know how to turn that part of me off.

352
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,740
然后我走进了你的办公室
Then I walked into your office.

353
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,140
你竟是被我视作人的...
You were the first person that I could see as a...

354
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,290
第一个人
a person.

355
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,270
你身上有某种特质
There was just something about you.

356
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,050
是啊  我那时正咬着一根笔
Oh, yeah, I was chewing on a pen.

357
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,380
红色的笔
It was red.

358
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,700
卫星定位系统显示他就在那家餐厅
GPS shows him in the restaurant.

359
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,840
绿箭肯定就在那
The Arrow's definitely in there.

360
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,960
要想找到他  我们必须靠近些
If we're going to find him, we got to get in closer.

361
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,260
我们已经靠得够近了
We're close enough.

362
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,640
你还记得我告诉过你
Do you remember when I told you that

363
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,030
由于我们所做的这些事
because of what we do,

364
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,630
所以我觉得
I didn't think that

365
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,550
我不可能和某个...
I could be with someone that I...

366
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,950
自己真心在乎的人在一起
that I could really care about?

367
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,250
是的  我记得
Yeah, I remember.

368
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,300
也许我错了
So maybe I was wrong.

369
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,390
奥利弗  你...
Oliver, are you--

370
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,630
奥利弗
Olliver--

371
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,360
她还好吗
Is she ok?

372
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,380
她昏过去了
She's just knocked out.

373
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,570
新闻上都在播这个
Saw it all over the news,

374
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,520
警察和消防员都赶到现场了
police and fire are on the scene.

375
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,700
是啊  我觉得留在现场回答问题
Yeah, I didn't think it was the best idea

376
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,190
不是个好主意
to stick around and answer questions.

377
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,310
你认为你所在地方正好爆炸了
You don't think you and an explosion

378
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,300
是有人故意为之吗
at the same place is a coincidence?

379
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,710
看这个
Hey, check this out.

380
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,140
是个卫星定位器  在你外套里找到的
It's a GPS. I found it on your jacket.

381
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,050
不过已经坏了
It's wasted now.

382
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,150
你今晚稍早时干掉了斯蒂尔格雷夫手下的一个人
You took out one of Steelgrave's crew earlier tonight.

383
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,300
那是个圈套
It was a set up.

384
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,700
那样他们就可以往我身上放追踪器了
So they could plant that thing on me.

385
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,220
奥利弗  我知道你在想什么
Oliver, I know what you're thinking.

386
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,850
你不知道
No, you don't.

387
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,350
听着  我不是别人
Listen, I'm not other people.

388
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,430
我很清楚你在想什么  那种想法错了
I know exactly what's going on in your head, and you are wrong.

389
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,140
狄格尔  有人在我身上放追踪器
Diggle, somebody put a tracer on me

390
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,710
而我却没察觉
and I don't notice?

391
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,130
唯一的解释就是
The only explanation...

392
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,400
我的注意力被分散了
I lost my focus.

393
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,170
探长  我们稍早教训过的人
Detective. The person we took down earlier

394
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,780
和今晚为爆炸案负责的人是一伙的
is working with whoever's respoesible for tonight's explosion.

395
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,840
又是斯蒂尔格雷夫的人吧  我猜
Another one of Steelgrave's crew, I'm guessing.

396
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,020
我现在就想知道  那个组织的领导是谁
Well, I need to know who's at the top of that organization now.

397
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,320
哪里可以找到他
And where I can find him.

398
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,730
我这就查
I'm on it.

399
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,130
你安全了
You're safe.

400
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,800
没事了  有我在
You're safe. I'm here.

401
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,460
我和你是一边的
I'm on your side!

402
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,590
这件事我来搞定  探长
Got this handled, Detective.

403
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,530
那些人炸了一栋楼
These guys blew up a building.

404
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,130
你觉得我会袖手旁观吗
You think I'm sitting this out?

405
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,100
嫌犯叫维尔纳·赛托
Suspect's name is Werner Zytle.

406
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,630
他是个真正的疯子
He's a real nutmeg

407
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,680
那你自己小心行事
Keep your head on a swivel, then.

408
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,430
我叫维尔纳·赛托
I'm Werner Zytle.

409
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,450
但你也可以称我为"迷魂"
But you can call me Vertigo.

410
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,770
"伯爵"已经死了
The count's dead!

411
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,250
有些人永远也不会死
Some things never die.

412
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,870
比如说你
You, for example.

413
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,500
真是令人失望
It's frustrating.

414
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,680
也就是说我还得更努力点
Just means I have to try a little bit harder.

415
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,830
"伯爵"可能死了  这倒是真的
The count might be dead, true...

416
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,790
但是他那美妙的"迷魂"却流传了下来
But his glorious narcotic lives on--

417
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,670
而且还被改良了
with a few enhancements

418
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,080
它能让你看到你内心最大的恐惧
that will reveal to you your greatest fear.

419
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,360
就像是凝视着真相本身
Like gazing upon truth itself.

420
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,410
离他远点  不然你就死定了
Get away from him or get put down!

421
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,890
不  不
No...no!

422
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,040
费利西蒂  赶快叫救护车
Felicity, call an ambulance!

423
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,620
你没事吧
Are you ok?

424
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,470
维尔纳给你打的精神药物还挺强劲的
That was a pretty strong psychotropic Werner hit you with.

425
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,360
兰斯警探的情况怎么样了
How's Detective Lance's condition?

426
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,020
稳定下来了  他现在在星城总院
Stable. He's at Starling General.

427
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,570
我黑进了急救人员的无线通信
I hacked the paramedic radio.

428
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,740
他的冠状动脉痉挛用药可治愈
He had a coronary artery spasm treatable with medication.

429
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,930
他不会有事的
He'll be fine.

430
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,200
你怎么样
How are you?

431
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,230
信不信由你  我经历过更糟的初次约会
Believe it or not, I have had worse first dates.

432
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,350
去街上看看
Hit the streets.

433
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,860
维尔纳不会因为我而放弃他的计划的
Werner's agenda can't stop with me.

434
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,070
我要知道他在谋划什么
I need to know what he has planned.

435
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,010
这就去办
On it.

436
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,940
我去支援他
I'll back him up.

437
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,870
罗伊一个人可以的
Roy's got it.

438
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,810
回家陪莱拉吧
Go home to Lyla.

439
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,660
奥利弗
Oliver...

440
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,310
如果这和刚才发生的事有关的话
If this is about what happened, man,

441
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,210
冒险是工作的一部分
risk is part of the job.

442
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,660
狄格尔  现在只是情报收集
Diggle. It's just intel gathering.

443
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,120
罗伊可以处理
Roy can handle it.

444
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,660
我知道我们要好好谈谈
I know we need to talk.

445
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,740
谈谈我们的晚餐
About our dinner

446
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,910
还是我们那被人炸毁的晚餐
or our dinner getting blown up?

447
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,110
-两件事都要谈  -没事的
- Both. - It's ok.

448
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,300
抓到这人后  我们再谈
We'll talk about it after we catch this guy.

449
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,280
也许我们得重新安排开董事会的时间
But maybe we should reschedule the board meeting.

450
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,170
不到一小时会议就要开始了
It's in less than an hour.

451
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,590
我能出席的
I've got this.

452
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,220
请不要起来

453
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,020
你还没好呢

454
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,970
大家什么时候才会意识到我不会说中文
When are people going to realize that I don't speak Chinese?

455
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,450
这是日文
Japanese.

456
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,170
你会说英文
You speak English?

457
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,390
比你的中文说得好
Better than you speak Chinese.

458
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,380
我在哪里
Where am I?

459
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,740
在我们的家里
Our home.

460
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,240
我和我丈夫的家
Mine and my husband's.

461
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,430
你丈夫
Your husband?

462
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,420
欢迎来到我家
Welcome to my home.

463
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,380
吃晚饭吗
Dinner?

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,140
我得提醒你  医生说不能对我吼
I got to warn you, the doctors told me not to get yelled at.

465
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,320
那你不在乎医嘱
Well, it's a good thing you don't care about

466
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,600
还真是件好事
your doctor's instructions, then,

467
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,550
因为你还是继续执行外勤任务
since you're still going out in the field.

468
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,870
你知道什么是事先医疗指示吗
Do you know what an advanced health care directive is?

469
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,870
{\an8}事先医疗指示  也被称为生前预嘱

470
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,770
那是你快死了的那次他们向我要的  爸
It's what they ask for when you're going to die, dad.

471
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,710
莎拉离开的那晚
The night Sara left,

472
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,830
你倒下的那晚
the night you collapsed,

473
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,750
急诊医生问我你是否有立过预嘱
the E.R. doctor asked me if you had one.

474
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,990
对不起  劳蕾尔  真的对不起
I'm sorry, Laurel, I really am.

475
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,460
对不起  宝贝
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

476
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,000
那你为什么一直这样逼自己
Then why do you keep pushing yourself like this?

477
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,350
我也不知道
I don't know how.

478
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,130
在你们姐们俩出生前我就已经是警察了
I've been a cop since before you and your sister were born.

479
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,280
我只知道这点
It's all I know.

480
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,170
如果我不是警察
If I'm not a cop...

481
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,090
那我还能是什么
what am I?

482
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,910
你是我的爸爸
You're my father.

483
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,310
我需要你
And I need you.

484
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,290
我刚和奈德·福斯特谈过
And I just spoke to Ned Foster.

485
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,750
他说董事会已经准备好了
He said the board is primed.

486
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,490
你只要走进去  令他们拍手称赞
You just have to go in there and wow them.

487
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,140
我很肯定这是商业术语
Which I am pretty sure is a business term.

488
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,060
恐怕我们发生了一点状况
I'm afraid we have a situation.

489
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,070
显然还有另一个投标人在竞投这家公司
Apparently there's another bidder for the company.

490
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,830
真的吗
Really?

491
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,580
是谁
Who?

492
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,230
我是雷·福斯特
Ray Palmer.

493
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,920
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

494
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,300
我很喜欢你的公司
Love your company.

495
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,440
很高兴再次见到你  斯莫克小姐
Nice to see you again, Miss Smoak.

496
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,770
你们俩认识吗
You two know each other?

497
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,180
抱歉我迟到了  交通堵塞
So sorry I am late. Heh, traffic was terrible.

498
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,620
所以我坐直升机来的
Which is why I took my helicopter.

499
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,890
停在你公司楼顶  希望你不介意
I parked on your roof. I hope that's ok.

500
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,510
你们会批准的吧
You guys validate, right?

501
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,750
见鬼的
Oh, frack.

502
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,670
两年前  星城的人们以为我死了
Two years ago, the people of Starling City thought I was dead.

503
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,290
但我回来了
I came back.

504
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,580
奎恩联合企业也一样能站起来
And so can Queen Consolidated.

505
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,010
伴随着星城国家银行的新投资
With Starling National Bank's new investment,

506
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,010
我们可以带领公司脱离破产管理  走向未来
we can take QC out of receivership and into the future.

507
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,800
这家公司是我的家人
I mean, this company's my family.

508
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,520
就像我母亲常说的...
And as my mother always said...

509
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,360
没有什么比家人更重要
there is nothing more important to me than family.

510
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,440
谢谢
Thank you.

511
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,300
很好的演讲
That was a good speech.

512
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,410
难以超越
Hard to top.

513
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,600
感谢大家今天的出席
Thank you all for coming out today.

514
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,020
我保证会言简意赅  不然先娱乐大家一下
I promise to be brief, if not a little entertaining.

515
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,690
那是其中一只我新出的智能手表
Ahh. Oh, that's one of my new smart watches.

516
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,200
对此我感到非常骄傲
I'm very proud of those.

517
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,910
你喜欢吗  对它的功能满意吗
You like it, it works for you?

518
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,150
好  总之  科学  数字
Yeah, good. Anyway. Science. Numbers.

519
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,240
我喜欢数字
I like numbers.

520
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,200
这些数字显示奎恩先生
These numbers show QC's performance

521
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,060
带领的公司绩效
under Mr. Queen's management.

522
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,170
我非常强调这点  顺便一提
I'm using that term extremely, BYW,

523
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,610
再顺便一提  这些数字
also BTW, these numbers

524
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,470
这不是华尔街上美化过的信息
aren't sanitized for Wall Street.

525
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,540
这是取自你们公司
This is raw information

526
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,020
服务器上的原始信息
from your company's own servers.

527
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,140
他怎么进去公司电脑的
How did he get into our computers?

528
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,800
在我看来他是使用了远程管理工具
Something tells me he deployed a remote administration tool.

529
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,380
但事实上
But the truth is,

530
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,860
这只是公司面临一个更大的问题的征兆
this company's woes are a symptom of a much larger problem.

531
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,960
那个问题就是星城
And that problem is Starling City.

532
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,360
如果星城继续衰退下去
Queen Consolidated can't hope to survive

533
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,320
奎恩联合企业就别想存活
if the city it's located in is dying.

534
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,320
猜怎么着  确实在衰退
Guess what? It is.

535
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,250
没人想继续住在这里
Nobody wants to live here anymore.

536
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,630
发生了两次恐怖袭击
And after two terrorist attacks,

537
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,830
不能怪他们不想留下
who can blame them?

538
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,780
这座城市仍然需要被拯救
This city still needs saving.

539
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,410
而那正是我对这家公司的愿景
And that is my vision for this company.

540
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,780
不止是让它从死灰中站起来
To not only see it rise from the ashes,

541
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,220
而是要带这座城市迈入新视野
but to take this city with it to that new horizon.

542
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,180
而那个新天地有个名字
And that new day has a name.

543
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,810
{\an8}闪耀的星城

544
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,280
奥利弗
Oliver!

545
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

546
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,700
我以为会按我们所想的那样进行的
I really thought it was going to go our way.

547
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,980
我也是  但也许帕尔默博士会做得更好
So did I. But maybe the company's better off with Dr. Palmer.

548
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,630
去年我没时间管理奎恩联合企业
I couldn't make time for QC last year,

549
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,500
现在想拿回公司  是自私的
and trying to get the company back now, it's selfish.

550
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,960
那是以前的我会做的事
That's something that the old me would have done.

551
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,910
这半天提醒了我一件事
And if the past 12 hours have reminded me of anything,

552
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,210
就在两年前
it's that two years ago,

553
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,140
我决定放下奥利弗·奎恩的身份
I made the decision to put Oliver Queen aside

554
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,740
当绿箭  现在木已成舟
and be the Arrow. It's not a choice I get to unmake.

555
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,420
昨晚你在餐厅  不是那样想的
Last night at the restaurant, you didn't feel that way.

556
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,370
面对现实吧  费利西蒂
Look what happened, Felicity.

557
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,390
奥利弗  爆炸不是你的错
Oliver! The explosion wasn't your fault.

558
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,620
当维尔纳用"迷魂"飞镖攻击我时
When Werner hit me with the Vertigo dart,

559
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,040
他告诉我他的配方
he told me that his formula,

560
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,040
它会让我们看到我们最害怕的
it shows us our worst fear.

561
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,860
而我看到了自己
And I saw myself.

562
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,610
你不会真的以为你害怕自己吧
You don't really think you're afraid of yourself, do you?

563
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,200
我想我是害怕如果我继续当
I think I'm scared of what would happen

564
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,670
奥利弗·奎恩会发生什么事
if I let myself be Oliver Queen.

565
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,820
有什么线索
What did we find out?

566
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,090
你知道我们把星城的犯罪首领
You know how we've got the number of crime bosses

567
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,380
减少到只剩三个了吧
in Starling City down to three?

568
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,820
这个新来的的维尔纳  想弄到一个不剩
Well, this new guy, Werner, he wants to make it zero.

569
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,700
赢得比赛
Take out the competition.

570
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,290
米哈尔·佩托夫  卢西诺·科斯塔
Mikhail Petrov, Luciano Costa,

571
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,550
新川町下沢
Shintawa Shimosawa.

572
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,990
他们现在在哪里
What are their locations?

573
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,690
我找不到他们的最后已知地址
I'm not getting anything off of last known addresses.

574
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,170
维尔纳可能正在带走这些人
Werner could be moving these guys right now.

575
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,750
我在用最快速度查找了  这些人
I'm going as fast as I can! It's not like these guys

576
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,080
身上又不会带着定位器
walk around with little GPSs attached to them.

577
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,220
除非他们真的有带
Unless they do.

578
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,250
佩托夫  科斯塔  町下沢 
Petrov, Costa, Shimosawa,

579
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,940
他们都在假释或保释
They're all on parole or out on bail.

580
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,500
{\an8}假释

581
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,260
脚踝监控器
Ankle monitors.

582
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,400
不对劲  他们都在同一个地方
Can't be right. They're all in the same location.

583
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,330
火箭竞技场  今晚的重量级拳击冠军赛
Rockets Arena. The heavyweight title fight's tonight.

584
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,530
那可是犯罪首领的圣诞节
That's like christmas for crime bosses.

585
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,880
那里应该会聚集两万人
There'll be like 20,000 people there.

586
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,740
他为了拿下一个人  不惜炸掉一家餐馆
He was willing to blow up a restaurant to take down one man.

587
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,320
为了拿下三个人  他会炸掉一个体育场
He'll blow up a stadium to take down three.

588
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,270
火箭筒炸弹没有这种威力  你需要
Yeah, but an RPG won't do it. I need you looking

589
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,560
找出一个更大的爆炸装置
for a large explosive device.

590
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,650
罗伊...  着装
Roy... suit up.

591
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,580
你要我负责哪里
Where do you want me?

592
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,060
留在这里
Here.

593
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,690
我不能让你参加实战了
I can't have you in the field anymore.

594
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,820
真的吗  为什么
Really? What changed?

595
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,120
你快当父亲了
You're going to be a father.

596
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,400
奥利弗  五个月前
Oliver, you've known for

597
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,190
你就知道我要当父亲了
the past five months I was going to be a father.

598
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,450
所以我再问一遍
So I ask you again--

599
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,040
-哪里变了  -我变了
- What changed? - I have.

600
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,650
我顶的风险不能让你分担
My risks can't be your risks.

601
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,440
因为  狄格尔  你有正常的生活
That... Diggle, you have a life.

602
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,240
新的生活  而这
You have a new life, it's...

603
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,850
是我所不能有的
life I can't have.

604
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,860
我懂了
I get it.

605
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,790
你和费利西蒂遭遇了一场爆炸
You and Felicity were in an explosion.

606
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,020
死了人  你们俩也差点丧命
People died, either one of you could have.

607
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,250
但你们没有
But you didn't.

608
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,000
你不能因此动摇  哥们
You can't let that shake you, man.

609
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,960
兰斯探长现在正躺在医院里
Detective Lance is laying in hospital bed right now

610
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,270
-都是我害的  -你等等
- because I let him-- - Wait, wait, wait!

611
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,490
这是兰斯自己做的选择
Lance is his own man who makes his own decisions,

612
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,900
我也一样
and so am I.

613
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
这次不行
Not this one.

614
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,130
奥利弗  我这两年为你的事业出了不少力
Oliver, I've given the last two years of my life to your crusade.

615
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,460
我虽然不好说我挣得了什么
I don't know what that's supposed to earn me,

616
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,780
但最起码给了我自己做选择的资格
but it earns me at least the right to make my own choices.

617
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,800
-你错了  -去你的  奥利弗
- No, it doesn't-- - Damn it, Oliver,

618
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,260
要不是我你早死了十次八次了
you would be dead ten times over if it wasn't for me!

619
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,980
你说得对
You're right.

620
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,750
但这毕竟是我的事业
But this is my crusade,

621
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,640
所以也该我来决定
which makes this my decision.

622
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,590
定时器定了5分钟
It's a five minute timer.

623
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,250
来啊  你等什么呢
Come on! What are you waiting for?

624
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,290
等我同伴  讲
My partner. Go.

625
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,730
我分离出了一个与引爆器同频的电磁脉冲
I've isolated a frequency spike consistent with an incendiary device.

626
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,530
就在看台下方的维修通道内
It's in the maintenance tunnel underneath the stands.

627
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,440
炸弹交给我
I'll get the bomb.

628
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,090
你去抓这些混蛋
Get the son of a bitch.

629
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,610
还想来点吗
Back for more?

630
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,790
看这样子  你是对"迷魂"
It's as if you've developed an addiction

631
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,670
上瘾了啊
to Vertigo.

632
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,010
我已做了选择
I've made my choice.

633
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,080
费利西蒂  时间快到了
Felicity, we're running out of time here.

634
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,060
好  根据你的描述
Ok. From your description,

635
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,340
这炸弹的电路应该可以拆卸
it sounds like a collapsible circuit design.

636
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,450
费利西蒂
Felicity...

637
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,640
剪断黄线
Cut the yellow wire.

638
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,280
没有黄线
There is no yellow wire.

639
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,910
那好  换个办法
Ok, new plan.

640
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,880
看你头顶  那里应该布有隔热管道
Look above you, there should be insulated piping

641
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,430
连接竞技场的空调系统  管道内是氟利昂
pumping the arena's ac system. They're pumping freon.

642
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,250
截断一条管道  对准炸弹
You want to break one off, aim it at the bomb.

643
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,900
应该能把它冻住
You're going to freeze the thing.

644
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,130
不管用啊
It's not working!

645
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,360
别太吃惊啊
Don't look so surprised.

646
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,960
我还没走多久呢
I haven't been gone that long.

647
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,300
尽管把我关起来吧  无所谓了
Lock me down, it doesn't matter.

648
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,430
"迷魂"是剿不干净的
There will always be a Vertigo,

649
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,840
永远会有人接手这生意
always someone to pick up the mantle.

650
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,070
而这动力正是来自于你
You have given it the power.

651
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,760
你难道看不出来吗  看不明白吗
Don't you see? Don't you see?

652
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,100
-你气色不错  南达尔巴特怎么样  -热
- You look well. How's Nanda Parbat? - Hot.

653
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,130
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

654
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,140
有人很想你
You've been missed.

655
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,620
我正要去看劳蕾尔  碰巧听见了你们的通讯
I was on my way to see Laurel, picked up your radio chattha.

656
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,200
你该转告费利西蒂  把通讯频道加加密
You should tell Felicity mix up her frequencies a bit.

657
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,110
好想法  你这次回来就不走了吗
That's a good tip. And is this permanent, you being back?

658
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,840
-我希望你别走  -再说
- I hope so. - We'll see.

659
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,800
你最近如何
How are you doing?

660
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,480
我  操心的事也不少
I'm... working through a few things.

661
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,990
给你个建议
Word of advice?

662
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,250
面具并不是我们的全部
We're not our masks.

663
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,890
我们的生活中也需要不戴面具的人
And we need people in our lives who don't wear one.

664
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,140
-你好啊  -你来这里干什么
- Hey. - What are you doing here?

665
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,080
你最好别是在跟踪我
And the answer better not be stalking me.

666
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,600
这得看你觉得定位你手机的卫星信号
Well, that depends on whether you consider

667
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,470
算不算跟踪了  好吧  我是在跟踪你
pinging your phone's GPS stalking. Ok, guilty.

668
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,190
但你知道我是怎么知道有人
But you know how I know a guy who would be interested

669
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,580
看中了你的专业技巧的吗
in hiring someone with your expertise?

670
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,880
没错  我还真用得上你的技术
Yeah, turns out I could really use it.

671
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,070
貌似有人黑了我的手机  我的笔记本
Seems somebody hacked my cell phone and my laptop

672
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,070
-还有桌面电脑  -哎呀  太糟了
- and my desktop. - Gee, that's too bad.

673
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,460
我所有的数据
All my data's been replaced

674
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,180
都被豪猪排气的音频文件换掉了
by audio files of porcupine flatulence.

675
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,070
所以我估计着这么做的人
And so I was hoping that whoever did it

676
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,570
没准乐意收了神通
might be willing to undo it

677
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,660
只要我为误导他们道个歉
if I apologized for misleading them in any way.

678
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,980
道个歉没准能行
That would probably work.

679
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,760
除非你误导他们
Oh, unless, of course, you did all that

680
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,420
只为了偷这个人的朋友的公司
to steal that person's friend's company,

681
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,750
这样的话  我建议你最好习惯习惯
in which case I would suggest getting used to the sound

682
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,420
啮齿类动物放屁的动静
of spiky rodents farting.

683
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,520
我什么都没偷嘛
I didn't steal anything!

684
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,390
好吧也许偷了点  但是到最后
Ok, maybe a little, but as it turns out,

685
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,430
我根本就没用上那些数据  你也听到演讲了
I didn't even need the data. I mean, you saw the speech.

686
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,530
很有说服力啊
It was a pretty good speech.

687
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,870
我的朋友刚刚当了父亲
My friends just had a baby,

688
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,950
如果你不介意的话
so if you don't mind,

689
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,480
我得去看望
there's another

690
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,270
另一个粘糊糊的小人儿[谄媚滑头]了
slimy little human that needs my attention.

691
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,280
对了  顺便一说
Oh, and BTW,

692
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,170
有空的时候也看看你的平板电脑
might want to check your tablet while you're at it.

693
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,640
她真是太可爱了
Oh, she is scrumptious!

694
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,160
恭喜你们啊  真心的
Mazel tov, guys, seriously.

695
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,510
谢谢
Thank you.

696

我可以以后再来
I can come back.

697
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,650
奥利弗  快进来
No, Oliver, come in.

698
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,300
她真是完美
Oh, she's perfect.

699
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,210
恭喜
Congratulations.

700
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,990
谢谢你  奥利弗
Thank you, Oliver.

701
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,890
为什么谢我
For what?

702
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,210
因为你对了
For being right.

703
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,840
我看到她的那一刻
The second I looked at her...

704
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,490
一切都变了
everything changed.

705
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,520
整个宇宙  都变了
The whole universe... changed.

706
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,570
你说得对
You were right.

707
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,610
我要怎么才能出去
How do I get out of here?

708
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,180
你不能离开
You can't leave.

709
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,940
那你来阻止我啊
Well, why don't you try to stop me?

710
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,950
你知道我可以的
You've already learned I can.

711
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,220
你试过很多次了
Repeatedly.

712
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,540
阿曼达·沃勒想让你为她工作
Amanda Waller wants you working for her,

713
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,680
她会有自己的办法
and she will have her way.

714
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,990
那她太不幸了  我宁愿死
Yeah, well, too bad for her. I'd rather die.

715
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,310
所以她威胁的不是你的生命
Which is why it's not your life she's threatening.

716
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,280
我要对你负责
I am to be responsible for you.

717
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,620
她找到合适的方法激励我了
She's found the proper way to motivate me.

719
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,380
她威胁了我的家人
She's threatened my family.

720
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,300
我放你走的话她会杀了他们
She'll kill them if I let you go.

721
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,770
我父亲生前喜欢一句谚语
My father had a proverb he was once fond of.

722
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,920
一人不能生有两名
A man cannot live by two names.

723
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,580
什么意思
And what does that mean?

724
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,330
放在你身上...
In your case...

725
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,000
意思就是你别无选择
I believe it means not having any choice.

726
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,670
他们看上去真的很幸福
They look really happy.

727
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,890
-她真漂亮  -是啊
- She's beautiful. - She is.

728
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,200
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

729
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,270
我不想跟你谈
I don't want to talk.

730
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,110
虽然对我来说  这是第一次
Which for me, I know, is a little unprecedented.

731
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,520
但是
But...

732
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,560
只要我们谈了  就结束了
as soon as we talk, it's over.

733
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,140
真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

734
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,860
我以为我可以做自己
I thought that I could be me

735
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,280
同时做绿箭
and the Arrow...

736
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,100
但是我做不到
But I can't.

737
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,310
现在还做不到
Not now.

738
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,770
-可能永远都做不到  -那就明确跟我说
- Maybe not ever. - Then say never.

739
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,950
不要  再模棱两可了
Stop... dangling maybes.

740
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,000
你明确跟我说我们俩之间不可能
Say it's never going to work out between us.

741
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,380
-说你从没爱过我...  -费利西蒂
- Say you never loved me, say you-- - Felicity...

742
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,510
不要让我说不爱你
Don't ask me to say that I don't love you.

743
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,900
我说过  只要我们谈了...
I told you as soon as we talked...

744
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,570
我们就结束了
it would be over.

745
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,970

我需要你给我些建议

750
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,400

我不想让他知道我来了

758
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,240
你是不想让他知道你来了
You don't want him to know you're in town,

759
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,040
还是不想让他知道你来的原因
or you don't want him to know why?

760
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,650
两者都不想
Both.

761
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,020
这种生活...

我们不想让你作出选择

不要为了我们去选择

765
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,940
我知道  我是为了自己
